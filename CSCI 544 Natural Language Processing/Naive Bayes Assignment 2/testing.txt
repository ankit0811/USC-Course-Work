0117CBUj98k8MKQp8svI The Hyatt Regency Chicago is a wonderful hotel    Me and my husband recently stayed there on a summer vacation  and it couldnt have been better  The staff was very polite and helpful  and the rooms were very clean  and they had some of the best beds Ive ever slept on  Not to mention the view was amazing  If I had to rate this hotel Id definitely give it five star  next time Im in town I will most definitely stay there again 
05P7vUPmaePGNE1MbNnr My fiancee and I were looking for a modern  upscale venue for our wedding reception  We have found the perfect location at The James  From the ballroom to the personal attention to detail  each step was handled with care  Now that we have locked in our date  we are more excited than ever  Thank you staff at The James for making our day even more special 
0MToxUvIFjSsmlJKJjGd We choose to stay at the hotel due to the high rooftop ratings at the hotel  Not only is the rooftop terrace on the 5th floor  but it was occuppied with private corporate events for the entire duration of our stay  We did   as recommended   have a drink indoors only to be highly insulted by their bartender there  There is no breakfast buffet   you order a la carte  Keep that in mind when paying extra for breakfast and internet  Also note that the minibar is empty on arrival   we were only told on departure that we would have needed to call reception to order  We have stayed at the Omni before and it as a much better experience  I dont recommend spending so much for a mediocre hotel 
0dicitbqsgWtbnwWrWUr Rude  rude  rude  We stayed here on July 4th weekend  We drove from Michigan  we called customer service to get directions from I 95 wc is a major highway to Chicago   calling them from a cellphone  telling them were in a middle of a storm and that were lost    we were put on hold  forwarded to another person who did not know how to get to the hotel and we were on hold again  Giving up we decided to just exit the highway and try our luck at a 7 11 store  When we finally arrived at the hotel at 2 am no one was there to take care of our car so we looked for parking ourselves  Checking in we were not greeted by anyone  even the receptionist did not greet us   no welcome to the knickerbocker  nothing  The man at the reception was rude  which makes me think what kind of customer service training this hotel has  The guy could not find our reservation and he seemed frustrated that we are checking in at 2 am   Well if they were able to give us directions maybe we would have been there 2 hours earlier  The room is not even spectacular  very small  probably a little bigger than a walk in closet  Stay here at your own risk 
0uI7wpIuOiMSi1e57c5X OK  we are back from the Knickerbocker and I would give it the best rating  I cant believe the bad reviews  I got a priceline deal  and I still got a fine room  clean  up to date furnishings OK a little traditional for my taste and smoke free  Someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews  I think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth  Here it is from my point of view  Both rooms on 10th floor  Regarding the size of the rooms  We had two rooms  One was a 2 double bed room  It was about 20 x 15  Each double bed had valences that were kind of mini canopies  The furniture  bathroom tile  shower no tub  wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years  A Chinese inspired cabinet held TV  coffeemaker  ice bucket  and mini bar  Three separate levels TV  icecoffee  and minibar The other room was called Queen executive  This one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence  sofabed  two TVs and terry bathrobes  Also about the same size but different configerations  One TV faced the bed  other in the three level cabinet  the sofabed  Smoke in the lobby  There is a bar to the right of the entrance  It is an open arrangement so that I am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door  No smoke smell in no smoking rooms  Cost of rooms 75 on priceline plus taxes  Very good value one block from N  Michigan Ave  Only complaint  Concierge said that the free trolley didnt go down Michigan Ave to Field MuseumMuseum complex when in fact it does  Was this ignorance or trying to throw more business to taxi Either case  not good  He said at this time of year free trolley only goes to Navy Pier during winter    which is clearly incorrect  
13FP7Y8OeoJthhiwMemy I can easily say this is one of the worst hotels Ive stayed at the  The receptionist up front was a snooty  sarcastic teenager or post teenager  You can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner  The room was dirty  stains on the carpet  the showerhead was moldy and rusted  the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches  The towels had a horrible aroma  The hotel is very narrow  so we were near a construction zone so  I would plan on waking up at 6 am if you choose the Talbott  The next day  I asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room  That room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop  I asked for late checkout at 1pm and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day  if were not out by noon  I had to speak to the manager who gave us till 1pm  Please stay away from this hotel  I think a Holiday Inn would be better  Andrew F  Gulli
1LAZAvcshueEMMyNyjlD I stayed at Sofitel with my husband for a weekend and I will NEVER be staying again  The staff was rude  the room was dirty  and the decor is ugly and garish  AVOID at all costs 
1OLdvidAOZQiQkk08HpN Superhigh Bill at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago My wife and I decided to take a weekend getaway to celebrate our anniversary  I told my wife that I would take care of everything  I booked the Millennium Knickerbocker because it had a great location  it was reasonably priced for a 4 star hotel and had spa features  The hotel loby seemed nice enough and the staff seemed fine  The problems for us started when we went to our room  I have sinus problems  so I didnt notice the smell in our room  and my wife didnt say anything to me because she wanted to go with the flow and not ruin our weekend  We couldnt find the remote for our television and we didnt call down  we were trying to be good sports  We were both disappointed when we realized that our hotel didnt have a pool or hot tub  swimming and relaxing in a hot tub is one of the reasons we go on vacation  Upon checking out I was hit was 250 dollar fee for smoking in our room  My wife and I dont smoke and there was nothing we could do to get out of the smoking fee  If that wasnt bad enough we were hit with a 50 fee for the missing remote control 
1oThiTzPBjoVQkEQLAHb A lovely hotel in a trendy part of Chicago which gives it a much more comfortable feel than the downtown hotels  The rooms are very  very well appointed  but not large  and the quality of the materials is wonderful without exception  Unfortunately  the service was below average in every way  they failed to deliver laundry by an important and assured deadline valets didnt deliver the car and had to be asked twice the concierge gave us miserable directions that got us lost  and the front desk was unable to rectify any issue  It amazed me that so much incompetence could happen in 6 hours  And even after recognizing their shortcomings  not one sincere or significant apology  A poster child of how bad service cannot overcome a well built  well furnished hotel 
26Qw2C6McQdum6yKPINj Arrived at 1 30am only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the dance club connected to the hotel  If you party and stay out all night anyway  this hotel would be fine  But dont plan to get any rest if the club is open  Front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while I was checking in  She was fine with me and gave me a corner room  but sure wouldnt want to be on her bad side 
2PgezlvJ6SVBpZnDg2XZ If you are looking for a true luxury experience  Hotel Monaco Chicago is not the place to go  I stayed here while visiting friends and decided to treat myself to a luxury experience  I did not get it  Check in was not a pleasant experience  The wait was long and the front desk staff were unfriendly and unhelpful  The room was ok  no roaches or anything  but it was small and cramped  And the mirrored headboard on my bed was more tacky motel than fancy hotel  The house cleaning service was really pushy and tried to clean my room at 8 30a in the morning  When I asked them to come back later  they gave me a whole 15 minutes before they came back  And getting extra towels was like pulling teeth  I dont know if they thought I was going to steal them or what  The room service food that I ordered was fine  but it took forever to be delivered and was half cold by the time I received it  When I called the front desk to complain  they apologized  but did not offer to compensate me or send me new food  They have a restaurant at the hotel  but I did not bother to try it  The prices were ridiculous  the menu was limited  and my room service experience assured me it was not worth the hassel  I was really disenchanted with this experience  At 400 plus dollars a night  I received mediocre accomedations and poor service  Spend your hard earned money somewhere else 
2d5BRRWlwkEb6QCFS6cJ The Knickerbocker hotel was one of my favorite hotels to visit  My wife and I utilized the park  play package  which gave us an amazing room  complimentary valet service  and a great kit to plan our weekend around  It was well worth the price and we both wish to go back again  The rooms were top notch and the hotels staff was excellent  One of the employees  Craig  helped us find our way around the city and this shows the Knickerbocker really cares about its guests  We loved our visit and are sure you will too  A
2hz7EZkqQ2TE1PuFnWuv Upon entering my hotel room at The Palmer House Hilton I immediately turned my nose up at a foul odor coming from the bathroom  After placing my bags on a poorly made bed I walked into the bathroom to find the last visitor had failed to flush the toilet  I immediately called room service and asked for a new room  They apologetically told me there were no other rooms available but would send someone right up to handle the mess  After oh around a half hour of waiting a very angry maid knocked at my door  She seemed very irritated to have to deal with the mess and looked at me as if I should have been the one dealing with it  After the room was cleaned up she turned to me as if asking for a tip  I hesitated and she angrily stormed out of the room  I thought things would run smoother and tried to relax with an ipod  Yes you can use your ipod in the room however what they fail to mention is the constant white noise because the signals are so poor  And nothing could compare to the remote control heating and air  When I was able to get the buttons on the remote to work the temperature seemed to change on its own  If I wanted hot air it would slowly get colder and vise versa  After giving up on a nice television program I decided to retire to bed  Egyptian sheets Right  All I can say is I found myself early to check out and in a new hotel within the next hour  If you value your back do not rent a room from this hotel 
2oCUzmh8sqblxs6BizGl I loved staying at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago  not only is it an amazingly friendly atmosphere  but they give me the option to bring my pet with me  They are a dog friendly hotel  it costs 55 00 a night for the dog to stay with you  but that beats the costs of paying a kennel to keep or your dog or a neighbor to watch them for you  I loved this option  They also give your animals a gift bag filled with treats  food  bowls and doggy clean up bags  I higly reccomend this hotel if you are looking for a place to bring your four legged friend with you when you travel  
2ytRyMaPcSG0aks9qFqk I have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood  cost and amenities  The hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open  you wouldnt know it  You need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock  The beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a nicer historic hotel  I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime  It was a very frustrating experience 
334kGhThdUEmadQo2s3r I was completely blown away by this hotel  It was magnificent  I got a great deal and I am so happy that I stayed here  Before arriving I was nervous as I had read a few bad reviews about the impact the renovation was having on peoples stay  for example very noisy  However  whilst the renovation was still going on and the gym was not open nor the restaurant  it made no difference to me  My room was huge  bathroom was spacious with excellent water pressure  bed was perfect and the view was amazing  Hotel is so close to the great shops of Magnificent Mile  plus a comfortable walking distance to Hancock tower and Millennium Park  
3CGWkU4Me0mLPlWZtvyd IMO the Amalfi doesnt come close to justifying the glowing comments on TA  This is basically a Holiday Inn  Half of the rooms overlook an alley  loading dock  The hotel is not more than 6 or 7 flors high and the garbage pick up woke me up daily at 5 am  At 530  when you are just nodding off again  they begin setting up for the complimentary breakfast  This is a continental buffet on every floor next to the elevator bank  Any room within 100 feet of the elevators will hear the noise  Reception was a bit tacky and the staff was a little rough around the edges  I didnt see a single business travellers while I was there  Valet parking was expensive usual for Chicago but was very slow  Just ok  Explore other options 
3IZeXta0jJeQcRhS2Iqv Have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted  Great Bar draught Stella and Guinness which was being upgraded at the end of March when I was last there  good food  lovely staff  large clean rooms  comfortable beds  spot on location for the Golden Mile  Joeys Pizzas next door are fantastic  Ignore any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the authors must either have been very unlucky or impossible to please  Highly recommended 
3KHzioyuHoC3lBf0hTLB As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro  I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left  She seems to have a cough today  In the room on my right  someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit  I hear the water running and the toilet flushing  I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs  Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms  Ive stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst  The room is dirty   the carpet covered in spots and stains  the curtains with a large brown stain I dont want to guess what it is  paint peeling  rips in the wallpaper  The decor is a bit garish  with Pepto Bismol covered walls  green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet  The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable  but Im so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others toilets flushing all night  The location is good for downtown theaters or business  Only three elevators serve this 17 storey building and they run very slowly  Chicago has many nice hotel options    many Ive enjoyed quite a bit  Unfortunately this is not one of them  and even more unfortunate for me  Im stuck here for two more nights  I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip  comfortable and attractive  This is not 
3amBp0sXP34ILx86lL9v The location of the hotel is great  right on the river and Michigan Ave  Almost everything is within walking distance  At the price  though  and given the 4 star hotel  we expected better walls  Our room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors  The sound from both rooms came in loud and clear  We heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone he clearly wasnt speaking loudly  and the other neighbors up at midnight yelling and screaming when they came back drunk  We asked them to be quiet I shouldnt have expected that to work with some young drunks then called security  but they did nothing  I was completely annoyed with the noise  especially in an expensive business hotel such as this one  Unless you are in Chicago to party  get drunk  and not get any sleep  I wouldnt stay here 
3iuoTv5B8ompTOlIjLjq My family and I recently attended a wedding in Chicago and stayed at the Swissotel  It was much nicer than we expected  We are used to staying at mid class hotels and this  by far  was one of the nicest places weve stayed  The beds were so comfortable and the crib the provided for my infant son was great quality   I was concerned that we would get a rickety 1970s crib  The bed sheets were so soft that I wanted to take them home  We will definitely go back to this hotel the next time we are in Chicago 
3wjOEFUcxbDtUd3kvehr I had my wedding ceremony and reception at the Sofitel  It seems as though I had the same experience as Judy L  I read her review and thought thats exactly what happened to me  Heres what happened  The good news  The actual event was great  Most notably  the food was absolutely incredible I think almost every one of our guests has raved to us about the food  The same goes for the cake  which was made by Take the Cake  The service by the waiters and other staff was also very good  The bad news  Michelle  the Director of Catering  honestly made my wedding planning process a nightmare  While we were negotiating the contract  she promptly responded to my emails and phone calls after the contract was signed  it was a constant struggle to get in touch with her to get my questions answered  to schedule the tasting  etc  She frequently took over a week to respond to a simple email  and she occasionally never returned my email or phone call until I called her a second or third time  I assumed things would get better within the month  or even the week  prior to my wedding  but they actually got even worse  Michelle just could not get it together  and if it werent for my wedding coordinators assistance in forcing her to finally get things right  I dont know what would have happened  Thus  if it werent for Michelles inability to do her job  I would have had a great experience  But  as it is  when I think back about my experience with the Sofitel  I unfortunately have very negative thoughts  And thats incredibly disappointing  considering it was a major part of the best night of my life 
3zqpjygbEl0rlKEdR9Rg The Palmer House has a beautiful lobby with a great bar and restaurant  The rooms are way too small    Two people in a room with a King size bed can barely move around  Not enough room for two suitcases  Our room was very outdated reminded us of the movie The Shining  VERY NOISY     Dont expect a quiet stay  You can hear EVERYTHING that your neighbors are doing and saying not to mention everything that is happening in the hallways  We requested a room change as soon as we checked in  The room that we originally were in had a huge square cut out of the wall that had exposed pipes  bricks  dirt and dust  Oh and the construction for their renovations starts at 7 a m  during the week  We will never stay at the Palmer House again  You are better off spending a few more dollars at a different hotel 
4FzGRuD2uyRpUk2Ng2Ky After some deliberation I booked the Sofitel Water Tower Place for a 3 night stop over in June  This was my first visit to Chicago and it turned out that we had a really great time  We loved our rooms  which were just the basic type on the lower floors but they were very well appointed  The decor is modern and personally I liked it a lot  The rooms were pleasant and airy and the bed extremely comfortable  The hotel location is just perfect  close to the shops on Michagan Avenue  and the beach at Oak Street  Lovely restaurants close by and nightlife in Rush Street is just steps away  The area although bustling was peaceful and quiet  We could walk to most places and I would not hesitate to stay here again  The hotel staff very helpful  always smiling and ready to help from the doormen to the helpful lady at Conceriage  I would not hesitate at all to stay at Sofitel Water Tower Place next time Im in Chicago in fact I look forward to my next visit  
4mS6T2i7iYvZrPe64rWH Booked a room w a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful NYE  and was rather disappointed  Bed was either the worlds smallest queen  or was actually a double  not to mention it was uncomfortably springy  Some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used q tips  Lots of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly  When the tv was off  there was a very audible high pitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv  Hot water was very inconsistent in the shower  It is in a great location  however  next time I will try one of the other hotels in the area like the Intercontinental or Marriott  This might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business  but I wouldnt recommend it for a romantic night or two 
4tA6FGYnjDx3NOwpXW9R Although the InterContinental Chicago Hotel is located on The Magnificent Mile  our entire experience as guests there was anything but     believe me  the magnificence ends at the hotel entrance  From check in to check out  our impressions ranged from lackluster to horrific  First  there was an error with our reservation  and once we got to our room  we found that neither our phone nor our internet connection worked  so down I trudged to the registration desk  where I had to wait in line for at least twenty minutes  to ask for help  The first night we spent was nearly totally sleepless due to TV noise coming from the next room we werent sure whether it was due to excessively inconsiderate neighbors or thin walls  Then  dog tired the next morning  even though we had hung a Do Not Disturb sign on our door handle  in barged the maid all bright eyed and bushy tailed with scrubber in hand  Following that rude awakening  I was jarred again by a blood curdling shriek from my wife  who  upon entering the bathroom to take her shower  was greeted by an incredibly large roach  Breakfast  actually all meals of which we partook at the hotel  were served cold and were somewhat tasteless  We were routinely ignored by the concierge  who always seems to be on a personal call whenever we needed him  Trying to leave the hotel was equally as difficult as checking in  Of course  there was a gross error in our bill which caused us to be delayed in our effort to depart  Getting out of the InterContinental Chicago was  believe me  the best part of our experience as guests there 
4yk1bDpPWlJzEQq2aJB7 I booked my room at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers somewhat reluctantly I was not enthusiastic about spending over 200 on this room after seeing the lackluster photos on their website  I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived that the lobby did not look as stuffy as it did online  Unfortunately  my hopes were dashed once again when I arrived at my room  I say at because after discovering my newly issued key was not working  I had to wait ten minutes before someone finally came to let me in  The room was painfully small   if I didnt know better I would have thought I was staying at a Red Roof Inn  The sweet sleeper bed had stiff and scratchy sheets  with a cheap motel thin coverlet  The disappointment continued after I entered the bathroom and found that it not only reeked of smoke  but also outfitted with the cheapest trimmings possible  I stayed my two nights  and was surprised to find out that all sorts of other charges were added to my room for which I was not responsible  charged on demand movies  an empty mini bar  AND for smoking in the bathroom  HAH  I have stopped payment on my credit card  and most certainly will not be submitting myself to this horrific experience again 
54WPSAk5lpKBGYC3tdjH Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is a four star hotel that is minutes aways from the Magnificent mile  Navy Peir  The museum of contemperary art  lake michigan and upscale boutiques  This hotel is great for tourest  it has 450 great rooms and 33 high end sweets  It has a modern diesighn and rich arcitechusall legacy  IT has great food and out door dinning it also has a great veiws  while drinking wine and champane cotails in there amazing bar  Overall this hotel is by far the best hotel ive stayed in 
5OFBwqjOgRceoNeFvJMd I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel  Staff was always courteous and helpful   from the front desk staff at check in to wait staff in Aria restaurant  to the maid who cleaned my room  The rooms were recently updated  with large flat screen TVs  beautiful linens  and exceptional toiletries in each room  My room even had a view of Monroe St  harbor  It is truly a first rate hotel  Location is south of the river and east of Michigan Ave    as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way if thats possible in downtown Chicago  however its location significantly lowers street noise  The hotel has excellent access to Millennium Park  the Aon center there is a connecting concourse  and is about 4 blocks from shopping on North Michigan Ave  I ate dinner in Aria and it was fantastic  Room service for breakfast was quite good as well  Overall  Id stay again in a minute if I had business in the loop  or leisure plans in Millennium or Grant Parks  
5VLyY68QHvdOZXDWuOnq We loved this hotel and would definitely come back  Initially we werent given a goldfish  which was disappointing  but then we left a tip for the housekeeper  and she rewarded us with one  We had fun sipping wine and playing Wii in the lobby every afternoon  The staff were quite friendly and helpful  even printing our boarding passes for us  Our room was very comfortable  with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper  At first we were worried about noise  since our room was next to the elevator  but we hardly heard it  and didnt notice any street noise either  The hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated  well lit  and ideally located  
5gpRbf5O2a0kzPgyQ845 This hotel has a good name and a good location in Chicago  Unfortunately I was very unsatisfied with this hotel  This is a luxury hotel  so you are paying luxury prices  So  I expect to get my moneys worth  Unfortunately that was not the case at the InterContinental  Firstly  my room was surprisingly small and unclean and could probably use a renovation and an upgrade in the furniture  Again  this is supposed to be a luxury hotel  and its expensive  I shouldnt be worried about why the carpet and other parts of the room seem dirty  I also had trouble getting the room to the temperature I wanted  Im not sure if there was just a problem with the air condition in my room or if its a problem in the whole hotel  The building is old and I suppose it has a lot of problems from being old  Secondly  I was disappointed with the quality of the service from the hotels staff  I thought they were somewhat rude and inattentive  Thirdly  this hotel has a lot of additional expenses  I felt like they wanted to overcharge me every chance they got use of the fitness amenities  internet  etc  When Im already paying so much for a hotel room  I get very irritated when I feel Im being nickel and dimed every chance they get  This hotel has a nice looking building  and again  its in a terrific location  But I really dont think its worth the expense  There are so many other hotels in Chicago to choose from that are so much better 
62D8Kykg7SSOyyaKavnP Our non smoking room smelled very badly of stale cigarette smoke  We were not allowed to change rooms  Also  the concierge staff was unprofessional  telling long winded personal stories to uninterested guests while long lines formed  The location was great  Hotel is dated  but would still be a nice place to stay if it werent for customer service issues 
6LpmM3KEER7xEUFCAEi1 Months prior to my 5 night reservation with the Hilton Chicago I requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light  facing an open view  not a close building  The reservation was made through a conference travel agency  I confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at check in the clerk noted it in my record  She told me it would be difficult to find  but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me  I was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers  tucked into a very dark corner  facing a wall of rooms  I called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request  but to sit tight and someone would call me  No one did  Further calls yielded similar results  At one point I was told I could have a parlor room  with a sofa bed  at a reduced rate  but I could not go see the room before committing to moving  Thats real hospitality for you  Worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave  I ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room  I had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds  The only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms  Other than that  it was tight quarters with a tiny closet  two uncomfortably low chairs  at the desk and in a dark corner  Light fixtures didnt do much to brighten things up  Since I was here at a conference  I really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for mid day calls and e mail  but instead I got a cave  Consequently  I spent as little time as possible in the room and next time I am in Chicago  conference or not  I will absolutely stay at another hotel  There are much better locations that the Hilton Chicago and looking at the percentage of inside tower rooms  places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service  Shame on the Chicago Hilton 
6WCfxlBbOYOj98NGa7cX The Conrad Chicago was by far the best experience I have ever had in travel leisure  Not only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable  but the food in the restaurant was exquisite  Not to mention the perfect service from the resorts employees  I was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs  Im naturally a fitness freak  so I was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor  Best of all  it was available to guests at any time  day or night  The resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area  so it wasnt a far walk to scope out the shops  The most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous Chicago looks all lit up  It was so relaxing just watching the city come to life  I was very disappointed when I had to pack and leave  Any time that I make my way back to Chicago  you better believe I will be staying at the Conrad Chicago  I recommend this resort to everyone I know who does a lot of traveling 
6jpkpKW9TchABerZMIeC What was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in Chicago turned into a complete disaster  The first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in   they knew we had 6  We ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel  When we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other  After some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor  unfortunately one of the rooms hadnt even been cleaned which meant more waiting around  The staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating  On our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5 30am  Despite my calls to the front desk  the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes  We also didnt know the hotel was sooo pet friendly  One morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door  I understand they allow pets  but really   people need to clean up after their animals   or have some dog free floors  While Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms  their service was terrible  the staff was rude  and I still cant get over that dog poo in the hallway  I definitely wont be staying here again 
6xodKb6Iu5VK041wjtLx Beautiful historic hotel    and since Im in historic building business  was looking forward to stay  Moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite  they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up    duct work torn apart in bathroom  lamp fixtures literally falling off wall  mirror torn off wall  etc  Ended up in a room on 20th floor    much nicer  but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions  Only two of three elevators to top floors work    and these two elevators skip floors  so you can be stuck waiting for ever  When I raised this to hotel staff  was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it  Umm  no  This is not an old building problem  this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it  Thumbs way down  stay away  Go to the Drake or Knickerbocker if youre looking for old world charm  sans hassle 
79m2X08UrbSzlByDF3DB What a gorgeous hotel  From the moment we stepped inside the warm colors of the lobby made us feel welcome at the Sheraton and in Chicago  The heavenly beds made the view from our room that much better  and to top it off with great restaurants  you couldnt ask a hotel for more  Starbucks coffee in the rooms were just an extra touch that guarantees well be back every time we visit Chicago  
7HdwCCHK6gsBl0oxugrO I was extremly unhappy with my recent stay at Affinia Chicago  When I arrived to check in  my reservation that I had made  and confirmed  2 weeks earlier  was not in the computer I had to wait 40 minutes in the lobby while a room was being cleaned for me  The whole time the desk clerk gave me dirty looks and texted non stop on her cell phone  while the office phone rang off the hook  I had no toilet paper in my restroom or trash can in room Ill never go back dont waste your money 
7WelnhXAKYQqBjKPSaIn Me and my wife recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago while on vacation  and I cant recommend it enough  The hotel is located right on Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago  and right next to tons of great restaurants and stores  The rooms are spacious and elegant they are modern and stylish without being crazy or garish  I especially liked the big flat screen TV and the very comfy bed  sleeping in hotel rooms is often far from relaxing but I had no problem falling asleep  I highly recommend the Hilton Chicago  Ill definitely stay there again  A 
7jhJ8GoK4e9jcL6Qoze8 I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel  after hearing all the good things about it  Unfortunately  it was a very underwhelming experience  to say the least  But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel  First off  it is located my favorite part of Chicago   the leafy  affluent part of town that is Chicagos equivalent of Manhattans Upper East Side  complete with sidewalks  quiet tree lined streets  real old school townhouses instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums  cute boutiques instead of Gap  Banana Republic and other mainstream mass produced brands and  of course  Hermes of Paris which warrants a separate mention  I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches  cherry colored wooden furnitures  area rugs and distinct artwork  The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains  I definitely love the room  While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan  getting a 400 sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task  So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous  ample bathroom  double sink  massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around  do a chicken dance  and strut my Herve and Louboutins in  My only reservation was the lack of natural light   the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th floor room  but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us  so cant have it all  Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service  or lack thereof  I mean  seriously  They dont call it the hospitality industry for no reason  I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say  a 3000 room Vegas hotel  First  I called in to reconfirm my reservation  The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent  First off  she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff  to whom I had to explain myself all over again my pet peeve when it comes to on the phone customer service  The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly  nor was he at all competent either  Case in point   he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in  which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there  But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving   it was about 1AM  As a general rule  I am never  ever  a big fan of room service  having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18 gratuity  10 5 tax and still expect a tip on during my days globetrotting on the companys expense account  Think overcooked steaks  lukewarm soup  bread hard enough to knock someone out  and ice creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite  So I really wasnt expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24 hour room service  but lo and behold  they do  I placed an order of chicken BLT  which to my initial delight came in within 20 minutes  Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of 2 on top of the 18 service fee refer above I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin  microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lays chips lightly salted flavor  The bread looked like someone stomped on it  the L and T looked like it was 2 days old  the B was unrecognizable  and the chicken was burnt and cold  It was pathetic room service at its finest  We did get the item taken off our bill rightfully so too but the front desk person was  instead of apologetic  defiant  The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving  its quite an accomplishment in and of itself  We wont be coming back  unfortunately 
83TcSj8fEaXW9dGkTBbi There is a great difference between a Hyatt Regency Hotel  and a normal hotel  The thing that I did not like about this hotel was the smoke section of the non smoking section was really close to each other  I get really uncomfortable when I am in a crowded area  and people are smoking their lungs out  Even though this hotel is really glamourous  has a nice bar  a nice restaurant  great music  it is still not a good stay if you dont like people smoking beside you 
89fMl9xz9no7r9kZhyha I stayed here August 20 through 23rd with my sixteen year old son and we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel  The price was very reasonable for a hotel located right on Michigan Avenue  The front desk and concierge service was excellent and enhanced our stay by making it easy for us to plan fun activities  The John Entwistle theme on our floor was a nice touch  Any of you single fathers out there can appreciate how difficult it can be to take a fun affordable vacation with your children and The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago really helped me accomplish just that  
8LNbD9lR0k7iouHUMzwO My daughter and I were in Chicago for one night after having attended a three day conference elsewhere in Illinois  We were only in Chicago on our way home  We didnt know where to stay in Chicago  but booked one night at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based on their ad in the Chicago Visitors Guide  Were glad we did  We enjoyed our stay very much  Our room was very comfortable and well appointed and had a wonderful view of the city  Thats what we wanted  a great view  and we got it  Also  the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is accessible from the bus stop we took the train and bus from the airport into the city and it wasnt bad  saved us a lot of money  The elevators to our room were fast and quick and there was one always available  We found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating  The only downside for us is that we had only booked one night in Chicago  We wish we could have stayed there at the Sheraton for at least another night  We would definitely stay there again  
8hdfqYqePsSBXcm1JQmS My husband and I recently traveled to Chicago on a mini vacation  We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in the downtown area  This hotel is simply beautiful  From the time we walked through the front doors until the day we left  we were treated as if we were royalty  I have never been treated so well  We were greeted by staff that sincerely seemed to love their jobs  We stayed in a Superior Corner Suite  The view of the city was the most amazing thing I had ever seen  The rooms were very spacious and clean  The king size bed was extremely comfortable  The room didnt seem like we were in a hotel  it had the feeling of home  There was a separate living room area which was wonderful  my husband and I just sat there one night and stared out the window at the skyline  It was mesmerizing  We ordered room service because we had a long day of shopping  which the hotel is very convenient to a lot of great shopping  Most everything is in walking distance  The food was to die for it was as if we were eating at a 5 star fine dining restaurant  We did manage to go down and have a few drinks in the lounge  The lounge had a classy feel to it  very relaxing yet sophisticated  We even received a massage  in our room  While we did have all the conveniences of home  such as internet and TV  we did not even think about using them  being that we just wanted to get away from our everyday lives  This was the most romantic vacation my husband and I have ever taken  I cannot express how happy we were to have stayed in this hotel  We had other options but I am so glad we decided to stay here  The rate for the room was so inexpensive for the amount of luxury we were able to experience  which the experience itself is priceless  I will definitely share my experience with anyone and everyone and recommend this hotel  
8pTTlprUkdRYyUy12PWK My wife and I just spent 3 nights at The Talbott  The room was spacious  comfortable and well appointed  The hotel is quiet although there is some construction nearby  Linens and towels first class  Free Wi Fi in the room  The location is terrific  just one block to Michigan Avenue  We will stay here on future visits  
8uzHl4upMzq9RaY3nvy3 Move beyond the rock theme and its an average hotel with a good location  Room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing  Thank goodness the window opened or wed have been cooked alive  That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave  This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting  Room was stuffy too  Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions  Wife happy w Aveda in bath  Base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey 
8z85qF704omPZUbTivpH Recently staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel  was a waste of money  The rooms are typical standard rooms unless you want to pay an unreasonable amount for one of the premier rooms  the service from the staff was nothing to rave about unless  your ideal  idea of service is waiting in the lobby for 40 minutes waiting for anybody to help you carry your heavy luggage up to your room  Sorry to say in short I think my money would have been better spent staying at a HoJos 
9693eYlNuCiDQJr0M1KB This hotel was worth every cent  You have not experienced Chicago luxury until you have stayed here  In town for a conference  my colleagues and I never had to leave our hotel for much of anything  Fine dining  entertainment  you name it  Knickerbockers got it  I will definitely return as my wife and I frequent Chicago to visit family 
9JJVHeui7ege0FjnCHuN We really enjoyed our brief stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker  From the front desk personnel and bellmen to the housekeeping staff and bartender  everyone we met was helpful and welcoming  Our 11th floor room was clean and beautiful  and the view looking north to the Drake Hotel and apartments across the street was nice  The in room coffee service was appreciated  too  There isnt a lot of room in the bathroom for your toiletries  but Id still take a room in a beautiful older hotel with character over a spacious but cookie cutter room any day  
9WrHb1vAcYkrOqKtyUdZ I had a large  roomy  clean 2 bed room with a large bathroom  big minibar snack assortment and was tucked away nicely in the corner so that there was no hall noise  Customer Service here was absolutely incredible  from the doorman to the front desk  to the gentleman who delivered my toothpaste to my room when I requested it  Sure  you get a little outside noise  but it is a big city  that is not unusual  I really enjoyed my stay here and strongly recommend it  
9YdSEdd7hHGWSb1KOQul I love this hotel  It is one of the best that I have stayed in  The lobby was beautiful and the room was nice and comfortable  The made services was terrific  No matter what time we left the room it was made up when we came back  I asked the maid for a couple of extras and she was very nice and friendly  That is what I liked about the hotel the staff was so nice and friendly  I was there with my daughter for a girls weekend from Thursday   Sunday  Everyone from the doorman to the concierge to the people at the desk etc  was wonderful  I cant say enough good about this hotel  Yes the bathroom was small  but I wasnt moving into the room  I was just staying there a few days and was hardly in the room anyway  I will definitely stay there again 
9n2qVRlp1gL4kPzA375j Wow  Loved the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago  It was so close to all the great sights of Chicago like Navy Pier  Lake Michigan  and all the fabulous dining  The hotel was very classy and the rooms were furnished in a traditional  but cozy manner  The entire family loved it  even the dog   because they are also pet friendly at the Ambassador East Hotel  We loved the restaurant there  the Pump Room was great  something to please even the pickiest of our eaters  We were there on a family get away  but asked to see a larger suite  The suites were gorgeous  I cant wait to tell our friends about this place  Our next business trip to Chicago  we are booking at this hotel  They have the perfect conference rooms and we LOVE the service  We are definitely coming back 
9rIQEwpHPhUtm0y2IyD1 My recent stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago was miserable  My visit began on the wrong foot when they couldnt locate my reservation  I had my reservation code and the email confirmation but they insisted they couldnt find me in the system  We finally agreed to scrap that reservation and start over  That process was lengthy as they were training a new girl on how to take reservations  The room that I had originally reserved King was not available and I had to wait 45 minutes for them to clean a Double room  I was so tired from the traveling and the hassle at the front desk that I decided to stay in and order room service  It took an hour and a half for my food to arrive  When finally delivered  it was cold and not exactly how I had ordered it  So now I am cranky  tired and starving  I ate what I could from the mini bar poor selection of items and went to bed  The room was spacious but had a stale smell to it  as if someone had smoked in it  The next morning I complained and wanted to change rooms  The woman at the front desk couldnt be bothered with me and didnt try to make things right in any way  I decided to check out and go to another hotel for the remainder of my stay in Chicago  I will never waste my time or money at The Talbott again 
A32j7GWmDyxkG2Le85WF Over all  my trip was great I got to spend time with my best friend  We did some shopping and site seeing  Trip was overall great  The only thing was our hotel stay was not up to speed with other luxury hotels I have stayed at  Some of the walls had wall paper missing  most of the faucets leaked  there was water stains on the ceiling in the bathrooms  some of the furniture had very visible stains  the fire alarm was coming off the wall in the main bedroom  we stayed in the corner suite on the 37 floor room 3711  Considering what ones pays for the room you would think the pool would be free and they would not charge for every single small amenity  I do not plan on staying there again  Apart from the trip was great 
AGaqwoZRZc5iyO7qqRz2 The Hotel Allegro located in the Chicago Loop  provided my wife and I with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory  We ordered the weekend Liquid Therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website  but to our surprise when we arrived  our names were nowhere to be found in their system  No room  no accommodations at the restaurant  nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot  A weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than I originally booked  and never did they offer us a replacement dining option  I have a receipt and credit card statement that shows our reservations being made on time  We will never be staying here again 
ANy3I81FCrKRxxVnGYWr The name Conrad the most luxurious of all Hilton hotels should illicit nothing but images of pure elegance and luxury however  the Conrad in Chicago  IL did obviously not receive the memo  Upon entering the hotel  we were not greeted by any of the hotel staff  Additionally  we were not offered any help  The desk receptionist was beyond rude  Her snide remarks towards my wife and me set the tone for a the rest of our stay  After getting our card  we were finally offered help with our luggage  The young man who helped us could barely handle our luggage  Strangely  he somehow found more strength when it was time to collect his tip  He received the tip he deserved  which he scoffed about and groaned under his breath as he walked away  Upon first looking at the room it was beautiful  However  closer inspection revealed that the room had NOT been cleaned since the last visitor had left  There was hair in the sink and around the toilet  There was even a used bar of soap in the bathtub  This fact was not met with any apology by hotel staff  Instead  I was told that was preposterous and that the room had indeed been cleaned to the highest of standards  Two hours later  someone came into the room to investigate  When they saw the mess that had been left  they offered a menial apology  Still another two hours later  housekeeping arrived  The level of incompetence even extended to the valets in the parking garage  In the most incredible display of stupidity of our visit  the valet actually brought the wrong car to me  I was half tempted to take the car that was brought to me it was certainly an incredible make and model  but my better judgment prevailed  I informed the valet of his mistake  to which he replied  Sorry dude  I read your ticket wrong  I know that he did not smoke in my car  but he smelled so strongly of smoke  that the smell melted into my seat  Luckily  its location on Rush will help get out of the terror that is Conrad Chicago  There are so many better hotels in Chicago    please spend your money elsewhere 
AgipsVMV4tGbrNTnTV45 After reading good reviews about I booked a 5 night stay  Checked in late bit called early in the day to assure wed have a roll away as well as the pull out sofa for 2 teens  They somehow had us booked for two rooms instead  Got that sorted out and arrived around 10 pm  Checked in and waited for our luggage    Finally went down and got it ourselves  The room was a little grungy  furniture shabby  and discovered a suspicious stain on the duvet cover  Ewww  Called for a new duvet cover which was delivered and unceremoniously handed to me  FYI its kinda gross to have to change the duvet cover in a hotel  Next day tried to iron a dress for dinner and the iron didnt work  Called for a replacement  waited a while  called again and was brought another iron which also didnt work  Third time was a charm  Oh boy  Too bad we paid in advance  Wont be staying here again 
AmIYCOaPaiDcKY59gen7 I stayed at the Allegro in July for 4 nights for a business trip  The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great  I had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny  but ours was perfectly fine  with funky  fun doors  The decor is a lot of fun  We were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise  The front desk staff was very friendly  and before we even made it to the desk  a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival  We were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to Navy Pier  For people who were upset about no free coffee   theres a Dunkin Donuts about a block away  I definitely recommend this hotel  
AqfCDBf1tz9Rp0WwATyB The Palmer House Hilton hotel takes luxury to a whole new level of existence  The rooms are beautifully decorated  with class and superior quality furniture  The hotels restaurant lockwood consists of delicious French and Italian cuisine  The location is in the prime area to downtown  and shopping areas  This hotel is suited for pristine guests  and those who are not willing to settle for less  If youre looking for not just any stay  but a stay in luxury  you should give The Palmer House Hilton a try  It is one of the best of the best in Chicago  and your stay will be one to remember 
AzL28J3FlYI2MZalSJE0 I have stayed at the Omni off an on over the years  On business  for personal trips  This trip started off quite rocky  and left me very un impressed  1 Be aware  they have a new policy where they charge debit card 55 per day for incidentals which you may incur  They do this if you elect not to use a standard credit card  Even if you have booked and paid for your room in advance  The desk clerk claimed all the hotels do this now   funny how when I put a remote employee at the OHare hilton on my business debit card  I was never asked for additional funds  Having a policy is one thing  spreading blame for it is another  While not a problem for me  someone who plans trips down to the dollar and dime might encounter a problem with this policy of theirs  To my knowledge  they never did this sort of thing before  I dont use Credit Cards  its why I have money in a recession   2 Rooms were clean  but their in room accoutrements and mini bar items had no price list  The only thing labelled with a price was a bottle of water about 600 ML for 7 50  As such  be careful with the tray of goodies  If the water is 7 50  imagine what the snickers bar might cost  3 Our suite had a bathroom sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which appeared broken  and would not move  Calling the front desk resulted in     nothing  Finally about 9 00 PM I elected to have another look at it  and it seemed to be off its track  I was able to successfully fix it  but the lack of response from maintenance  considering the rate for a suite  is sad  I remember this hotel being much more attentive and responsive  4 The seem to cut a lot of corners on room stocking now  Overall  I think I will be skipping the Omni  and they will get no more of my business  It seems Hilton treats people better overall  Its quite sad  as I have a lot of good memories with Omni  I will not be back 
BC2kVafgho6cQhbBWwK8 Just returned from a week in Chicago with the family  This hotel was perfect for us  Location is great  kids loved the pool as a place to wind down after a day of museums  touring  ball games  etc  We checked in through Hilton Honors Desk as opposed to the regular check in line  Even though our reservations were through priceline at a reduced rate  they gave us a pick of the the rooms  The room had a large closet which helped with the amount of gear we had with us  Used valet parking which was hasselfree  We had a great experience and would stay there again  
BfRHvevz2tYUPaGEVHgC We had the pleasure of enjoying a stay at the Affinia Chicago Hotel  We found it conveniently located on E  Superior Street  near many local attractions  The rooms were modern chic with a very urban feel  The pillow menu was awesome  my partner and I have such different preferences  the choices made it easier to sleep like we were at home  The hotel room layout was comfortable and spacious with all the right touches to make our stay perfect  I couldnt believe the amenities available to guests  My Beagle  Betsy enjoyed her stay at the Jet Set Pet care center  She was pampered as much as I was  It was such a comfort knowing we could bring her along and that we could enjoy our stay without the stress and concern that comes along with traveling and pet ownership  Another feature I personally enjoyed was the Walking Tour Kit  It included an iPod Shuffle pre loaded with a workout playlist  a deck of cards guidebook that included walking tours  and comfort items like a towel and map  I felt like I was the most important guest surely  everyone felt that way as they checked in to their rooms  Highly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to travel in the area of an Affinia Hotel  
Bp8naE4OjkaH2hHm3iU5 It has been a couple of years since I stayed here  and got it for a night last weekend on Hotwire  I paid only 100 and stayed a Saturday night  I was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel  The lobby has always been great  but the rooms were a little shabby in the past  Not any more  as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years  The location is still amazing  and with the Berghoff open again  there is a great restaurant within walking distance  
C3PQtKwPIgRrBNwfPZPG Upon first entering the hotel  we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen I have ever encountered  Through our 2 week stay  they told us to have a nice day as we left in the AM and welcomed us back upon our return  Breakfast is served in the AM  and the servers were as delightful as the bellmen  It was a very enjoyable stay 
CCLX9NBBqHeFzm7AiNYb Just got back from a 10 day visit to Chicago  For the rate of 219 per night  it was extremely good value  Reception staff were efficient  courteous and very friendly  I was given a room on the top floor 32nd floor facing the lake and the John Hancock Tower  The rooms were large and very comfortable  HousekeepingTurn Down Service were efficient and thorough  Bathroom amenities were very good and replaced daily  This is definitely my first choice for a Hotel in Chicago  It is also very close to all the shops  restaurants and the subway  
CR5dA0c1stiZChjx78WD I would like to add a comment  maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination  My daughter was married in May of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the Sofitel Water Tower we were amazed  She always wanted a ballroom type of wedding  and Sofitel made this happen for her  They took care of all the invitations  cake decor  and so much more  The special day for my daughter was worth everything  If you are going to be in the Chicago area  check them out you will not regret it 
CUNgn3sRE2HIcrrFbUnm I stayed in the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago last week  and I was extremely disappointed with my experience  The breakfast buffet was minimal and did not seem to be frequently restocked  I came downstairs about 30 minutes before the end of the breakfast period to find about half of the food options completely depleted  Also  the milk provided for the coffee and cereals was warm  having been kept out on the counter  I would have been better off bringing my own food  Also  the layout of the rooms is extremely awkward  I had to move the furniture around to be able to watch TV  and then move it back before I could make dinner or comfortably use the room in other ways  I could barely close the door to the bedroom past the corner of the bed  It just wasnt what I would expect from a Hilton brand hotel suite 
CfQgTVkACwrDJww7WPYh I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers for three days while I was in Chicago on business  This was quite possibly the best hotel experience that I have ever had  which says a lot considering the fact that I stay in hotels quite frequently  The staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating  They made sure that I had absolutely everything that I could want or need  Their friendliness came across in a very genuine manner  not fake or forced like some employees can be  The room itself was to die for  The bedding was so soft and the room was extremely clean and well kept  I cannot speak highly enough about the quality of the mattress and bedding  Because of the mattress and bedding  I got the best three nights of sleep Ive ever had  The views of downtown Chicago were absolutely amazing from my room  The way the city lights sparkled stole my heart and almost made me want to move to Chicago  The food was amazing also  I made it a point to eat at all three of the hotels restaurants and visit the bar while I was there  My favorite restaurant of the three was Shulas Steak House  The Chi Bar  the hotels bar  was amazingly designed and the drinks were great  All in all  i would rate my experience a 5 out of 5  There is nowhere else in downtown Chicago that compares to the Sheraton 
CkPJx1N79IDFOEENtHYI Ideal location right in the heart of the Near North side but good grief  they need more than two elevators  You can wait 10 minutes for an elevator and if you happen to be on the first floor registration desk on 6th floor  you can face a long line just to catch one  Rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all Homewood Suites   very utilitarian unlike many locations however  this one does not include a DVD player in the rooms  The pool is OK but theres no jacuzzi  Oh  and housekeeping is deficient when it comes to keeping the towels stocked in the pool area  Front desk service is pretty good 
CrVVDGgyi27PO9rpSlvD After reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel  I went ahead and got an Ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness  I normally have a good experience with Intercontinental hotels  particularly the Mark Hopkins in SF  I called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as Ambassador Club  When I arrived at the hotel  there was no separate check in line as advertised and the manager on duty basically ignored me when I told him I was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room  I was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty  They gave me a room in the modern tower  built in the 60s which was about 23 the size of a regular room at the Mark Hopkins built in 29  I had to deal with torn sheets  cracked marble sinks  and the spare roll of toilet paper being located OUTSIDE the bathroom inside the closet   how convenient is that The closet door  if you are not careful  may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door  I was not provided with a key to the minibar and I called for turndown service  which never happened  The next day  they finally got around to the fact that I was an Ambassador Club member and entitled to an upgraded room  but since I travel with a medical device which I already set up in the tiny room  I declined  To their credit  they did send some of the amenities I would otherwise be entitled to as an Ambassador Club member  I would not stay at this hotel next time I go to Chicago  There are other better places for the money including  the Omni  The James  The Fairmont  Hyatt  Sheraton  Monaco  Crowne Plaza  even the Holiday Inn and Marriotts located in the same general area 
D9iFnNVX8ze7E46cHsLO The Hotel Monaco Chicago was a great hotel  The rooms were very nice  great customer service  Every member of the staff was extremely nice  I liked that it was pet friendly  and you couldnt even tell they allowed pets  Very clean  Prompt service when requested  and the food was very tasty  An A in my book  the prices were very reasonable as well since it is a four star hotel  Very immaculate  Will definitely stay there again the next time I visit Chicago 
DGMBEMw4y1YlmHqddst6 I chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed  The previous weekend  I stayed at a 2 5 star hotel a few blocks away  and was much more impressed there  The Hard Rock had a number of issues including  very dark room   not much light artificial or natural lots of street noise very cheap decor and furniture broken cabinet door very warm room   said they would send maintenance  but they never arrived had bar charges on account that were not ours  Overall  I was very surprised that this was a 4 star hotel  I expected a much better experience 
DVdGt7Y4kUOabm2fOWsQ This is a wonderful hotel with all the amenities  Everyone was helpful  The breakfast buffet was wonderful  The bed was just like home  We would definitely stay again  A nice touch was the water bottles left in our car for us to enjoy on our way home  It was little touches like this that make this hotel one of the best  
De4IDjcgjjjybLK6OM8I Last month  my husband and I stayed at the InterContinental Chicago while we were in town for IMTS  Although they were very busy  the service was excellent and very professional  The staff were always smiling and happy to help  InterContinental was conveniently located near Michigan avenue  and the best stores and restaurants in town  The view from our room was great  Our room was always clean when we arrived home at night  it was decorated nicely  and the beds were extremely comfortable  We ate at the hotels restaurant Zest  and the food was great  It was by far one of the best hotels we have visited in a while  We will definitely be back 
DkD6uaAoeV1U8oQ4rhdk I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago  IL  and boy was I surprised  The hotel looks nice from the outside but the smell from the river is noxious  In fact  the smell was so bad one night that it almost made it difficult to sleep or even think of eating  As if this were not enough  the bathroom of my room looked like it hadnt been cleaned in a month and their were stains on the fresh towels  Towards the end of my stay I saw a mouse on the ground floor and could only imagine what other critters may be lurking in the walls 
Dqn2ARIIyugP1RElrWuf My wife and I decided to stay at the Amalfi while we visited friends in Chicago we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this Luxury hotel to any of our friends  Amalfi claims that your stay begins with a warm greeting  but we received the exact opposite  The front desk clerk was rude  sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question  and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room  Apparently there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog  who we had to bring at the last minute  The room on the Pet Floor was alright  nothing spectacular  and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered up dog urine  We proceeded to dinner at Keefers Restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time  I have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant  The next day  I could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly  and had to finish some work at our friends house  My wife had called for some extra towels and pillows  which took about half an hour to receive  She also ordered breakfast because Breakfast in Bed WAS her favorite  until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them  We were set to stay for 3 days  but only managed to stay 2  We will not be staying here again 
DyQPLLqBkcVhBcVxKdPU The Homewood Suites is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago  It is a great place to stay as a family  The last time my family and I visited Chicago  we stayed and picked the Shedd Aquarium package  What an amazing time  The Aquarium is great  and we saved a lot of money by buying this package  I also appreciated that fact that our room had a kitchen  With two really picky children  it was so nice to be able to cook  or at least to have the option  We also enjoyed the many neat facilities in the Homewood Suites Chicago Downtown  Nice pool  great workout room  breakfast buffet and the wine and beer dinner in the evening  I wouldnt stay anywhere else when I visit the Windy City 
E6Zn8Nhx1rO17Gu5eT01 Affinia hotel in Chicago was one of the most interesting hotels I have ever stayed in  Everything looks very nice and fancy  though the people that work there must be from the projects of Chicago  The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life  When we went to check in  first we had to wait about 15 minutes for the 3 workers that were at the desk to stop their personal conversation and check us in  When the women at the counter finally acknowledged us  she was smacking her gum  and was upset and treating us like we were inconveniencing her  The room service brought us cold eggs for breakfast  and the attitude of the staff overall was extremely rude  I would NEVER go back  and I hope this place gets a staff makeover if they want to stay in business 
EEKIJzxbybOlRfYfRYiP Dispite what other are saying  this was one  if not the best Hotel stay in Chicago I have had  I travel to the Big City about three times a year for pleasure and The James rates up with the best  I was upgraded and the staff made the stay worth my special weekend visit  I dont believe you will be disapointed  
ESRRWcpK0ZNoiYsrURoR I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower  My husband and I had planned a trip to Chicago for our tenth wedding anniversary  We had gone to great expense to fly his parents in from California so they could have time with their grandchildren  My husband and I had not gone on a honeymoon because he we got deployed to Iraq the week after we got married  Everyone was so excited  Mark and I had reservations for one of the junior suites  We hadnt gone to Chicago before to be tourists and were looking forward to the view which was offered  Unfortunately  when we got to our room  the view was disappointing  We had requested a non smoking room and were assigned to one  but it was obvious to us that someone had smoked in there  I am asthmatic and became very ill  We asked to be moved to another room  but were told there were no other rooms even downgrades available  Nothing was done to try to make up for this  Because of my health  my husband and I checked out within hours of arriving for our romantic anniversary weekend  This is not how I had imagined spending such a special time  Now  when I think of my 10th anniversary  I will always have this memory to tarnish it 
Ec8lujZLxkPuO5AQGTVC When you enter the lobby at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel you immediately see that this is a special place where you are going to be pampered  The staff are very friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to assist you in any way they can  The check in process is smooth and friendly as I expected  When you enter your room the decor catches your eye  Luxurious yet not stuffy is how I describe it  The restroom tub is large and made of marble  The whole room is tasteful and made to make you feel special yet at home  I highly recommend The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel to anybody looking to escape for a while 
EoOTjBX7WKXnR4ccf70L I booked a room at the Hyatt through Priceline and was able to get a rate of 45night  Cant go wrong with that  The rooms are nice  spacious  clean and contain all the amenties a traveler would need  I have to say that I have fallen in love with the Hyatt chain due to their customer service  I have stayed at a few of their hotels in different cities and the staff has always been extremely friendly  which you dont often see at other hotels  I used the self check in machine  and the customer service person checked in on me to make sure everything was going smoothly  Then  when she saw that my room was not on a high level  she offered to have it changed for me so that I could have a better view  I would highly recommend this hotel  
Eu8yYnoJdhQWuMjKzocB We enjoyed the Hotel Monaco  Great location for walking and beautiful rooms  The staff was so friendly and we especially enjoyed the wine reception and getting to meet other guests  Will definitely stay there again 
FAZmQQ4mJ0ZYPccZN0UI Hotel Monaco is simply amazing  I travel quite a bit  and am use to generic hotels  with horribly unimpressive rooms  and 5 star amenities which usually mean a packet of instant coffee  and room service that wont serve after 9pm  Hotel Monaco on the other hand was very impressive  The suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy  This hotel has such personality  My absolute favorite part of my stay  aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs  was the in room spa treatment  Hotel Monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me  Generic just wont do anymore 
FG7HdLIE8u992MEmkooN The Palmer House Hilton is located in the heart of the theatre  financial and shopping districts of downtown Chicago  It is walking distance to museums  shopping  government and corporate buildings  The location makes it perfect for visiting Chicago  The rooms are luxurious  with super comfortable beds and soft sheets  The rooms was clean and quite nice looking  The hotels restaurants are amazing  The hotel would definately exceed your expectations  whether you are a business traveler or there on vacation  
FmU5ETfNEQTpzrw4onwc I was really excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading several reviews online  Unfortunately  it was a very disappointing experience  When we arrived  we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was oversold  So  we had to move to another hotel  Amalfi did take care of the other hotel  cab fare  and after much negotiating   breakfast  We were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very inconvenient  Instead of getting up the next morning and going to the museum as we had planned  we had to get up  pack up our suitcases  check out of the hotel  take a cab  check back into the Amalfi  only then could we head to the museum  We were also told that our first nights stay would be refunded  Well  more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls later   there still hasnt been a refund  I cant even get a manager to call me back  The Amalfi wasnt all bad  it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance  The coctail reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers  However  it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended  One reason we picked the Amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of doubles  but they seemed really small for queens  Our view from our room was of the alley  So  overall the best part of staying at the Amalfi was the night that we were sent to another hotel and had a wonderful view of the city from the 22nd floor  Very disappointing indeed 
FxIDQLkH8aphrw7K4xXI The James Hotel met and exceeded our expectations  A haven of cool  uncluttered comfort in a hot  crowded but congenial city  Located within steps of some of the greatest art  architecture  culinary and cultural opportunities anywhere in North America  the staff of the James provided us with a home away from home for the week we visited  The check in was quick and flawless and the king suite a calm  restorative oasis  It is difficult to over praise the friendly  attentive staff this is a hotel that truly has its act together  The day before our visit ended  we experienced problems with the rooms air conditioner  When the technician was unable to quickly solve the problem  we were immediately upgraded to a one bedroom apartment with stunning views of the Chicago skyline  We eagerly await the opening of new James Hotels in other cities  
GBEoNgUk3SYrVnEjtuuY My first trip back to Chicago in about 7 years was perfect  I chose the Knickerbocker as I had read that their rooms were recently renovated on top of being a great location to Michigan Avenue  Rush Street and downtown Chicago  I must say I was very impressed with the guestrooms  I had not stayed there prior but it definitely is a refresh from what Ive seen in photos posted on the reviews  The guestrooms are nicely decorated with a modern feel and they are good sized for a historical hotel  The beds are wonderful    I need to get a pillow top mattress at home  I used the Internet access with no issue and I LOVED the larger screen TVs  The shower is fun with the different types of shower heads you can choose  And the bathrooms are fresh with all new granite and tile  Im anxious to get back to Chicago and it wont be 7 years from now  I would highly recommend this hotel    fantastic guestrooms  location and staff  Ive added some digital pictures of my room as they are completely different from the ones I saw on previous reviews with the new renovation  
GLYPdQOw2b0sXRDfjhn9 I recently had my wedding at the Omni Hotel in Chicago and I was more than pleased  The decision to use a hotel as my wedding reception venue was at first a hard one  I was worried that a hotel would be too impersonal but once I met with the staff at the Omni I was certain that it was the way to go  The staff was so attentive and friendly  and I felt as if my wedding was the most important thing at the hotel  I highly recommend the Omni Hotel in Chicago  brides will not be dissapointed 
GPiXIkPxnSYRz5Nkh8ga I stayed at the Talbott twice in the last few weeks  I was very pleased with every facet of my stays  The staff  from doormen to front desk  to concierge  to housekeeping  were wonderful  The rooms were nicely sized and clean  and well stocked  I will return to the Talbott anytime  
Gfw7qyFoz6Sp7XUJAvDf I wrote an email to the sales  reservation team a week ago         im still waiting for a response  All I wanted to do was book a suite for 2 nights but they failed to even reply with an offer  We have now booked another hotel who can be bothered to answer emails  Shame you missed out  coz we tip like rockerfellers  
H9dyua6wcoVPPzxx79Pi My husband and I and our 10 month old took a quick trip to Chicago  We stayed one night at The Palmer house after reading that they were a four star hotel  I guess I am just confused as to why they are a four star hotel  Yes the lounge area is nice but the rooms were so small I couldnt set up a pack and play for my son  I had to call and upgrade my room just so my son could have someplace to sleep  The lower levels have been updated which makes them slightly better than a Holiday Inn  The wall paper is peeling away from the walls and the shower was dirty  I will NEVER stay there again 
HHNXXZhkXiHX4Cw8qSFj Stayed over Memorial Weekend for 2 nites  2 rooms  Great Hotel  we always love breakfast in morning and drinks in even when applicable  Around the corner from magnificent Mile and close to lots of restaurants  Staff was great  we even checked in early before noon and other room available less than hour later  Fresh fruit was available to us and bell guys are cool  Suites are on small side compared to other homewoods but no complaints here  house cleaning kept our room clean and we felt safe  
HbG398VBk5oOiEh2rXh1 This hotel was everything we were looking for  My mom and I were on a girls weekend out shopping trip and just needed a place to stay after a long day out  The Talbott Hotel was incredible  The rooms were very clean and spacious and had everything we needed  The hotel check in was easy and the guest services folks were awesome  They even gave us tips on great restaurants in the area  Highly recommend this hotel on your next trip to chicago 
Hontx6jiDU8WozzERmOi This hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years  The first room they gave us was a shock  TINY and the bathroom was a joke   you had to step inside  move out of the way just to shut the door  The furniture is disgusting and all the wood trim was VERY beat up and painted over about 100 times  so they transfered us to the executive suite That room had a tiny bathroom   I mean TINY  The furniture was hideous and dirty  It was on the 3rd level so you heard every conversation on the street below and traffic was loud  The only impressive part is the lobby   but dont be fooled  because after that    the floors above look like they need a major overhaul   and the rooms were not worth even 100 per night  we stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through Priceline deal  I dont think we want to do Priceline again only because they have the Knickerbocker as a 4 star Hotel and we dont ever want to go back there again  2 Stars at best for the dumpy Knickerbocker  They should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing guests to stay in those rooms  Boomer  Naperville  IL
IGHiE9AvzriUCocfdhGh I found this hotel in the Small Luxury Hotels of the World booklet having stayed in many of these in recent years  and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels  I therefore chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from England  The Talbott was excellently located  although i had a view of a building site  and did have an ambience and some charm  however it was a little dirty and faded around the edges and the service was appalling  I had to wait in the foyer well after check in time  having previously attempted to check in earlier  tired and in need of a rest  while a final check was done to my room  The valet parking was not outside when requested  breakfast was not included in the price  all the things requested of reception did not occur  and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special  I have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant  where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel  I was severely disappointed and cannot recommend it at all 
IUhR7bup55UYGRCLbJOJ The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower was horrible  The first tip off that this would be a bad experience is when we had called ahead to make sure it was OK to check in after hours and that a concierge would be available when we arrived only to find out that they didnt even have a record of our reservation  After much inappropriate arguing  they found our reservation and we were assured all would be fine  When we checked in we got a dirty room without any working wifi or TV  It took a few calls to get fresh towels and for them to turn the heat on so we could sleep comfortably  The next day we called to get our complimentary room service that most decent hotels provide free and they had no records of us even checking in  A quick check with the credit card company had they charge already pending in the wrong amount  We finally left in disgust and got a much better hotel  the FancyPants Hotel and Suits with complementary airport shuttle and award winning preferred member rewards club  Overall  the service at the Sofitel was rude  rooms were unsatisfactory  restaurant sub par  not well kept up or clean  In the future I would never stay there again and wold definitely pick a more reputable hotel with a proven track record  like the FancyPants Hotel and suits  my personal favorite 
IafKXbpz6L7BOd9Cw26t The Omni Chicago Hotel was in one word  dreadful  The hotel is in the heart of the city and traffic is chaotic  The service is terrible  If you want to wait for your room for 3 and a half hours this is the place to go  Throughout a whole week  beds are made once and bathrooms are never cleaned  The hotel is no help when looking for a nice place to dine or a fun place to visit  they give no info for any activities going on in Chicago  This hotel should be listed in the top 10 WORST hotels in America  Do not waste your time nor money staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel 
IhP3aQEKTxv1PMnm3E5t I havent actually stayed at this hotel  yet  but am already disappointed in their customer service  I visit Chicago quite often and usually stay at the InterContinental  but yesterday I read some online articles advertising The James Hotels Cyber Monday Special  The promo states that if you buy a gift certificate from their website  the hotel will match that amount in James Credits that can be used toward your stay  None of the articles gave an expiration date for these credits  My next trip to Chicago is in April  so I thought Id give The James a try  I travel frequently with my pet and Ive heard they have a very liberal pet policy  So today I went online and bought a 500 certificate  Me  having the one track mind that I do  somehow missed the part about the credits expiring March 31  2010  I realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my predicament  I said I couldnt be in Chicago until April Im overseas on business until then  and asked if they could extend my credits an extra month  or it not  refund my gift certificate purchase  I had only just made the purchase minutes before and hadnt even recieved my email confirmation yet  Most businesses offer a 24 hr grace period  The girl at the front dest was extremely rude to me  basically saying too bad  its your problem now  She didnt even bother to act polite or pretend to be sympathetic about my situation at all  So now that I know this is the kind of service I can expect from The James  I might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel  or try Hotel Monaco  I hear they have great service and are good with pets too 
IrjHq7vEr4Cj5Lv7luaw This hotel is a shambles furniture literally falling apart and a staff that is both rude and uninformed  nevermind the lack of security and the absence of the so called amenities  The fitness center is an oversized closet  We were appalled during our stay  Truly anticipated warm  Irish hospitality and short of a barman  no one was Irish  warm or hospitable  Manager was unresponsive to our needs and front desk attendent was incredibly rude when we made a simple request  Her manager  refused to come out of the office when she called to ask them to speak with us  Room was pretty at first glance but when dresser drawers fell out and the major construction of the hospital next door began at 7 30am it is not the kind of experience anyone could tolerate  To call this a Red Roof Inn would be an insult to RRI  The manager that finally called us back was soooo fake and insincere that we would have prefered no call at all  The only thing they have going for them is the location but its not worth the trade off 
Iy9mQzFLpshZVfUmFQb5 Our stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was extremely relaxing and pleasant  We enjoyed the location  We could easily walk to the Red line or access the bus lines along Michigan Avenue  We felt safe walking along the neighborhood streets and viewing the fabulous architecture that is on N  State Street and Dearborn  We walked to 3rd Coast Cafe  the Chicago History Museum  and Second City from our hotel  Our room was spacious and well kept  and it was quiet enough for us to take a nap during the afternoon before heading out again in the evening  We would choose to stay there again even if we could afford more expensive locations downtown  We definitely enjoyed the neighborhood feel of the place  
J3AzcN33YTaUSzvNVQG8 The Hard Rock hotel is great for a relaxing getaway  The rooms are quiet  the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size  We had fabulous service and got a great rate  Other than the fact that there were no bathrobes its listed as an amenity and the Sony radio didnt work  it was perfect  Would definitely stay there again  
J7lMgbXtshX9Bsc3OTQd Beautiful views and awesome service  My husband and I stayed at the Swissotel in Chicago while meeting up with some old friends from college  We have been to Chicago a few times but never stayed at this hotel before  First off the architecture and feel of the hotel is just amazing  So beautiful  The views from our corner suite was breathtaking and the accomodations were flawless  The fact that we could have an apartment like setting rather than a cold hotel room made all the difference  From the big tub in the bath to the entertainment system and work area  everything is in place to make your stay like being at home but with an awesome view of the Chicago Skyline  We took advantage of the Executive Club for desserts and breakfast and had dinner one night at the Palm restaurant  Delicious food  We will definitely stay at the Swissotel the next time we visit Chicago 
JM9pQp3Hm5lUR6bTFgfb MY WIFE AND I STAYED HERE LAST WEEKEND  IT WAS OUR HONEYMOON AND IT WAS WONDERFUL  THIS HOTEL WAS SO BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT  WE WERE MORE THAN PLEASED WITH OUR ROOM AND THE RESTURANT WAS AMAZING  ALL OF THE STAFF HERE WERE VERY NICE AND POLITE  THEY HELPED US WITH ANY OF OUR NEEDS  I WISH I COULD LIVE IN THIS PLACE  ALL TOGETHER IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST WEEKENDS OF OUR LIVES  WE PLAN ON COMING BACK AGAIN  GREAT HOTEL 
Jc26lHOTgXEKVhFfyHBV Recently  I traveled to Chicago for a business conference and was lucky enough to stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago  The whole experience was wonderful  The room was spacious and beautiful  and the bed was so comfortable that I had no problem falling asleep  as I normally do at other hotels  The staff were polite and courteous  and after a delicious breakfast in the restaurant  I went to my conference with a smile on my face 
KLrAJkX8wsMBHYvaYJZ1 i valeted my lexus and it was returned with a smashed side mirror  They admitted it was their fault  and now they wont pay the 500 to fix it because we cant prove it was not broken before    the hotel is wonderful  the rooms are new and nice  but we will never stay here again because of this    Be sure to inspect your car before you leave 
KgYmVuFScNyfCrwpGPA0 Sometimes you just cant find fault with a hotel  even if you tried  Such was the case with Sofitel  where wed never stayed before  Its a sleek  modern  sophisticated hotel with European touches  We spent three days there on a leisure weekend  we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the Hancock Building  at a total cost including taxes and lugs of about 165 a night  The room was average sized  well appointed  everything in it worked  and it had a fabulous view of the Chicago high rise jungle  including snippets of the lake  The public areas were wonderfully decorated  The restaurant served a good breakfast at  for Chicago  reasonable prices  The staff was excellent  My wife broke her ankle several weeks before we visited and was on crutches  The staff loaned us a wheelchair and was very helpful in assisting her  
KtPi9swFlL6gMp6AKCgd Last week I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for 4 days and 3 nights and I was very pleased with the experience  As soon as I approached the front desk  I knew right away the staff was friendly and courteous  They had given me a list of local attractions such as the Museum of Science and Industry  the Broadcast Museum  the Ford Center For The Performing Arts and Willis Tower  I stayed in a junior suite which included a king size bed  a 27 inch television  non allergenic feather pillows and a variety of other amenities  The indoor pool was rather large as well as the gym which includes countless treadmills and even a jogging track  Eating in the area is not a problem as the Hilton Chicago is home to Kitty OSheas which is a restaurant offering authentic Irish fare  In conclusion  I had a wonderful time staying here and I can not wait to plan my return trip to the Hilton Chicago 
L2YSnPm1CHU3aMy18RLm The Omni Chicago Hotel is a very high quality hotel  This hotel is a very comfortal and high tech place to relax  It has everything you could possibly want to relax  workout  and feel luxurious  A must stay at hotel  I give it five stars 
L7RYYYApYIQTZGvUZn1e this is my new favorite place to stay in downtown chicago  and Ive been to this hotel at least 4 times  the rooms are clean  wonderfully designed and comfortable  The staff is friendly  service focused   and the restuarant is great  especially for the breakfast fruit crepes  Love this hotel  Its a great location  very good and consistent service and quality   
LQ5WWv14MijIoIhUtPyy Our suite at the Knickerbocker are quite nice  but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal  First  a member of the staff entered our room mid day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present  Not a tremendous problem  but when the young woman at the front desk replied What do you want me to do about it with the tone of a flippant teenager  I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff  Fast forward to this evening  Following a lovely meal off the premises  we chose to turn in a bit early at 11 30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions  the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room  Acting prudently and with restraint  we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs  but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response  Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel  and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume  On one hand I appreciated his honesty  but on the other  I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property  Since were out of options for the evening  weve decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being  but given the circumstances  the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession  Also  I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night  a possible gang related shooting took place mere blocks from the property  This wouldnt have been a concern if like nearby hotels  the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby  Would I stay here again Maybe on a dare  or if someone else was footing the bill  Yet Ive had better experiences in road side motels  and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests  and more importantly simple common sense 
Lg4XrYxV6akQkFM2WYbP Our vacation was highlighted by a four day stay at Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown I believed it would be the best part of the trip I discovered it was an unfolding nightmare  While in our lovely room on the fifteenth floor  a voice emanating from the phone  informed us of the pending fire alarm and what procedures to follow  Anyone above the tenth floor was instructed to go into the bathroom  wet towels and place them along the bottom of the closed door Do not use the elevators and wait for further instructions We nervously waited for twenty minutes without any further communications from the voice in the phone We then decided to exit via the stairs  realizing too late that once you entered the stairwells  doors behind you were locked We continued to travel downward  against the backdrop music of sirens and loud muffled speakers Obviously  we were rescued without any physical injuries yet emotionally we were damaged I now choose my hotels in the range of ten floors or less 
LwjQd562HZw7ywhEmthV My family chose to stay at the Chicago Hilton during our last trip to the city  We wanted something luxurious and centrally located without having to pay exorbitant prices  I can honestly say we made an excellent decision in picking the Hilton  The staff treated us well  the rooms were clean and roomy we loved the Serenity beds  and the hotel itself is stunning  It was like stepping back in time  We loved that the Chicago Hilton was close to numerous attractions  The weather was lovely  so it was great to walk to Navy Pier  Sears Tower  and the Adler Planetarium  We will definitely stay at the Hilton the next time we are in Chicago 
M67Pv5PFGXD23q0lKO2f The bathroom toilet leaked water all over the bathroom every time it was flushed  so we called maintenance to have it fixed  We returned to our room only to discover the maintenance personnel had left a nasty mess in the bathroom and the toilet seat was covered in grease  There were dirty clothes all over the bathroom and they even used our guestroom towels to clean their hands and tools  We love Chicago but we are never staying at this hotel again 
MH0UF8Rd9wvl0Rjaukvv I will never use Ambassador East Hotel again  The first appearance you get is a very dark and dreary type setting  The exterior of the hotel was in desperate need of repair  The customer service was not as good as you would expect when spending your hard earned money on a hotel room  In this hotel you are spending more than the average amount of money on a room that is smaller than the average hotel room  I felt rushed out at check out and didnt have an enjoyable experience at all 
MUZN0vfvLi7WED7hXIjq It was my first time to visit Chicago and I would say  id definitely go back  not just because of the Air and Water Show that we really enjoyed  but most importantly  because of the hotel that we stayed in  The Millennium Knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests  but with pets too  At first I was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog  but I was surprised it turned out the other way  Ive experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and thats really frustrating  its just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly  I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit Chicago  
MdIIGEwUvadjce3GgFjZ This is a great place to stay while visiting Chicago  My husband and I went over the holidays to see my family and we stayed at this hotel  We could not have asked for nicer people  Everyone was always smiling and very helpfull  We usually stay at the Ramada   but will never stay anywhere other than the InterContinental Chicago hotel again    Casey L  Skinner
MsHt28gxeOGfx9RZrjrR The Hilton Chicago boasts to be one of the greats but falls into a cliche of a hotel  There are many different rooms with a supposed array of choices from King with two bathrooms  Lakeside view or suites  It only looks good on paper that is until you get your bill  You will pay a huge fee for what seems like a nice upgrade but gives you nothing in return  The staff is nice but when I stay at a hotel I do not go out of my way to seek out the staff  The casual dining atmosphere might be nice for a college couple looking for a getaway but it will not be cheap  Next time I stay in Chicago I will be looking elsewhere 
N73RgJuzwx6eyHFlTUCj This hotel was great   In a great area right downtown and close to everything  The daily happy hour had great food  wine and premium liquors  The free breakfast was even better  Actually I believe everything was included breakfasthappy hourbusiness centerWiFi  Our room was a king size facing the back of the building  Really clean new and comfortable  Small touches such as books and cds to enjoy made the room feel less like a hotel   Would highly recommend  
NNG16WA8Vpy4hG3WKSNI This hotel does not live up to the reviews  The room was larger than I expected  However  the decor was a bit dated  The bedding was ripped  carpet was stained  and the shower door was broken  There was a long wait to the elevators  and if youre on floors 2 6 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym  The main issue I had was the attitude I received from the staff  There was literally only ONE nice person at the front desk  There are no ice machines in this building  so you have to request it from the front desk  One day I requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person  20 minutes later I made a follow up call because I did not receive my ice  I was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and I should just wait  I finally got the ice 10 minutes later  Two days later I requested ice again  Waited 30 minutes and just gave up  While I was leaving  I mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said I didnt get a call for ice  Well I obviously wasnt making it up  lady  I called and spoke with someone  She didnt even apologize or offer me anything  Overall  I would not recommend this hotel  There are so many hotels in the Chicago area  Choose a different one 
NXngeZjSVY9GrI6fjsSS The sheraton was a wonderful hotel  When me and my mom flew in we were really tired so we decided to take a quick nap  We didnt want to get up  The beds are absolutely to die for  I wanted to take it home with me  The service was great and this was probably one of the biggest if not the biggest hotel ive ever stayed in  They had a really nice restaurant inside with excellent food  
Nk2AXt5E2CBhA9EqWBRC My husband and I stayed at the Omni after attending a wedding that took place there  We were delighted at the luxury of the rooms and the accomodations were wonderful  Everyone from the concierge to the housekeepers were friendly and professional  We were extremely pleased with the whole experience and look forward to our next trip to Chicago so we can stay there again  And  by the way  the wedding was absolutely gorgeous 
O3DeBCEBg5xq4m2Sa5zQ I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a total of three days  and through out my stay I had a wonderful time  The room was impeccably clean  as well as the pillows and sheets  The beds were large and extremely comfortable  The staff though  in my honest opinion  is what made my stay so pleasant  From the people at the check in  to the waiters at the restaurant  I got the best customer service  The hotel was also conveniently located  It was within walking distance to the shopping center  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying at around the area in Chicago  
OBmGsZRRTHNVSRcIPvMI While the parking service was great   the front desk was terrible  We had a huge problem getting ice one night   we had none in our room so we went twice to get some   no one was there to help  called the front desk they promised to deliver some   none arrived so we called again   they said we had to come and get it and would not listen to what we had to say about what had already happened     read more
OH0upJ17TcJ3G0rDOs6q Terrible time at The Talbott  When I planned my vacation to Chicago I called ahead and made reservations to stay here  When I went to check in I was told I didnt have a reservation  knowing my credit card was charged I argued with the guy who was working  Finally the only option he gave me was to speak with someone else  Thankfully they knew how to use the computer  I go up to my room and there was a terrible smell of beer and feet  I could not believe it when I complained  I was told to spray some air freshener  I had to go visit family  When I got back my room key did not work  Once again there I was complaining to the helpless employee  He told me the magnetic strip must of came in contact with a magnet  I could not believe the mentality of this guy  I had one more night reserved  I could not take it anymore and I went and spent the rest of my vacation at my Aunts house  I would not recommend The Talbott to anyone 
OOroDnQlNqN6ftiYZoDR I travelled to Chicago last week with my daughter for some Christmas shopping  We booked the Conrad based on the reviews on Tripadvisor  It lived up to all expectations  Great big room  with two king size beds  Very comfortable  Breakfast was great  loads of choice and plenty on the plate  Great location  connected to a shopping mall which was very useful the day it snowed  All and all  a great hotel and we would go back in the morning  Chicago is a great city with very friendly people  
OeBKQy7XnJRpyV5QPRAk I stayed at the Palmer House for  150night on a corporate rate  The bed was excellent  the linenstowels were top of the line  I did not find my room shabby  as other reviewers noted  The Palmer House is over 130 years old  Rooms have older woodwork and classic furniture I think that lends to the ambience of the place  It is expensive  and Im not sure Id stay there if my company werent picking up the tab  But the hotel itself is still awe inspiring  
OjXqosASqd7cOmw7RDUR the experince at the hard rock hotel in chicago was fantastic i will rate them a 6 out of 5  they have wonderful service and great staff and the view is just wonderful 
P08RjE6rVWqKwEqgGvxD At first my husband and I were really excited for our family to enjoy the T Rex Experience package  We figured it would be a great deal package even though the hotel itself felt too ritzy for us to travel with our four children  But after two nights of downtown Chicago fun we realized that The Talbott transcends its ritzy look and truly embraces a family friendliness which we thoroughly enjoyed 
PALM26Mg43YKKJY2hRbd The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed at in a while  At almost 500 a night  one would expect  Traveling with my wife  I expected to pay the cost of the room  already being outrageous  but then I was hit with another 20 charge for her to stay  Even with a King bed  they only figure in one person to their cost  The beds were average and although there was much to do  everything cost an arm or a leg  It was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away  All in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis  if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night  I definitely would have stayed somewhere else  I guess you live and you learn  its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations 
PJVmPksK7BCwieyXfLWl We planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip  I booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast   get a quick bite  then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff  Well  our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly  and thankfully  switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights  The room was dirty  When we opened the sofabed  the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out  Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used  and theoretically cleaned  a lot  Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms werent much better  Temperature control in the room was imprecise   minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night  it made for a cold stay  If you like to eat for free they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights and dont care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer  I guess some may find this place tolerable  But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral  The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area we switched to The James and had a great experience  I couldnt be paid to stay here again  Im shocked by the high overall rating given our experience 
PXOniTDmYewiEtjnYO1y The Ambassador East Hotel Hello my current visit to the Ambassador East Hotel  I really enjoy my 3 day weekend stay at this Hotel  This was my first time at the hotel and I reserved a king size suite  Inside my room there was nice view of Chicagos Gold Coast  I really needed to get some work done for my business trip and this room was perfect for the situation  I could easily relax on my king size bed  I watch HBO on a enormous size flat screen TV for free  Also when I did do my work there was nice wooden desk in my room with a desk lamp and wifi modem  It so nice to have my laptop with me and able to use it on a good workstation in my room  After finishing my work I have time to check the complimentary fitness room  Lastly I left the next day  I had one of the finest breakfast dishes from their Pump Room restaurant  Overall the Ambassador East Hotel is a 5 out 5 hotel and really worth the stay  
PgTqcKctsjfo0nSeqohs Last week  I booked a Deluxe Suite at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago  I took the Retreat and Relax package deal  The wait to check in was intolerably long  because they were letting some people check in with a dog  Im allergic to dogs  and Im sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in  They insisted on escorting me to to my room  every time I came in  like I was going to break into another guests room or something  I swear  anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks  asking me if I needed anything  You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think youre up to something  I went to the pool  but it was full of screaming children  When I went to bed  I could hear the television in the next room through my wall  And whats worse  they wouldnt even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress  They threatened to throw me out on the street  after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars  I had to go outside   probably where the dog went to piddle   to do it  Also  their on site restaurant is too expensive  given that youre already paying an arm and a leg for the room  The food should be free  I wouldnt stay here again  it was a waste of my money 
QBGpT8OknQsltetjyXFi I recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel and it was awful  When I arrived my room was not ready  Two hours later when it was finally cleaned  I entered and saw they they had not brought the cot that I had requested for my son  I asked for it again  but they never brought it  My mattress was uncomfortable  and I did not like sharing it with my son  The AC did not even work and it was terribly hot in the room  The next morning we ate the continental breakfast before leaving  and it too was bad  There was cereal  low quality yogurt  and burnt flavorless muffins  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone 
QTb3SWpWxgkmCwNHudMo The Affinia is virtually the perfect hotel for a visit to Chicago  My wife and I stayed in an upgraded suite  Very large room  that is modern and has all the little touches  The staff was extremely helpful and professional  The location is excellent  The price is a good value for what you get  We simply couldnt find anything to criticize  Highly recommended  
QanwgshL6HWcUIurlE8z I thought the Swissotel was a great hotel  The rooms were very spacious and clean  especially for downtown Chicago standards  Most importantly  the rooms were quiet  I never heard people in the hallways when I was trying to sleep  The only downside was that the beds were not anything special  Sure  like all hotels in Chicago  this hotel caters to wealthy andor business clients with ridiculous minibar and parking price  However  if you are aware of that prior to arrival  its not a big deal ie finding a different place to park the car  bringing our own snacks for the room  It would be nice though if hotels such as the Swissotel had a microfridge in the room for guest use  Staff was very helpful  Bellmen instantly got cabs upon request  and the front desk was efficient and helpful  Overall  if I can get a good rate again  Ill stay at the Swissotel the next time I am in Chicago  
QmXYCOZxCIbf6JpsDcRH When I made my reservations at Softiel in Chicago  I was expecting the ultimate in Luxury but Softiel failed to deliver  Everything was just ok  I do not spend money on a quality hotel for just ok  If I want just ok Ill check into the Days Inn  First of all there were problems with our reservation  I asked to have a room near the top floors and my room was actually only on the fifth floor  The desk clerk was less than helpful to fix this  I eventually got it fixed but I certainly did not feel at all like a valued guest during this process  Later when I went down to ask for directions and information at the desk the clerk was very cold and abrupt with us  The room was quite nice but the shower did not deliver adequate water pressure  On the second day of our stay  housekeeping did not refill our soaps or coffee  They also failed to empty one of our wastebaskets  Minor I know  but when youre paying for a luxury experience  you kind of expect luxury  The hotel itself was nice but the staff really dont deliver  I would not stay here again  You can get a nice clean room at LaQuinta for 14 the price and the staff is much more helpful 
R14T4ZVlun9j9stBIeLb The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is perfect for a romantic get away  My husband and I spent a weekend away from the kids there and I must say  we were impressed by the staff and the accomodations  We especially enjoyed the in room spa service  I recommend the Amalfi to anyone wanting a nice hotel in the downtown Chicago area you are within walking distance of shopping with great customer service and luxury accomodations 
R6bxo49wFEuakOIreBSi I enjoyed my stay at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago  The staff was friendly and helpful from the time I checked in all the way through checkout  The hotel was very clean and well maintained  The beds were very comfortable  The hotel restaurantlounge was very cozy and a nice way to unwind after a long day  The only thing I was unhappy about was the fact that internet service is not complimentary at this hotel  I reccomend this hotel and I will stay there again on my next trip to Chicago 
RWbxHGV2APR1rxXx7g6X I just returned from a stay at this fabulous hotel   what a treat  The hotel website offers a great rate  and what I found was affordable luxury  I asked for a high floor  found myself with a fabulous view  in a room where there was an orchid spray in the bathroom  terrycloth robes and slippers  turndown service  Roger Gallet toiletries  a fluffy down conforter  and a wonderful pillowtop bed  The bathroom was so clean that it sparkled  The service was impeccable as well  Even my room service breakfast was way above average with an incredibly generous basket of excellent croissants  brioches   pain au chocolat  The decor was unique  the location convenient  Check out the stunning flowers throughout the lobby  This is a topnotch hotel  
Rhob9KZdn0O8cKdlciph I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference  I was very pleased with the hotel  The doorman offered me an umbrella as I headed out for a walk    and sure enough it started to rain very soon after  I would have been soaked with it  Upon my return  the doorman then asked about my walk  etc  This is reflective of all the staff I encountered  The front desk promptly checked me in  DEFINITELY register for their rewards program before you arrive    The complimentary gym access is excellent  plus you save on internet access fees which are waived for members  The bathroom and separate dressing areas were large and convenient  The only negative  no coffee maker  AND the Starbucks in the adjacent building is closed on weekends since the area corporate offices are closed those days    Otherwise my stay was perfect  considering the conference rate was 99 per night  
RtcQ9kJqjrw4IoEsJyPh Location is excellent  but dont valet your car there 53 00 a day  Bed was to soft  pillows were flat  we couldnt open up the mini bar cabinet because the bed was in the way  All in all not what youd expect from a hotel in that area 
S0mcPRghmfyISpPKZQDf My family has dubbed the Omni in Chicago Fawlty Towers because there always seems to be something wrong  This time our room was right above the kitchen and the odor of cooking grease wafted through our bedroom all night long  It smelled like a greasy spoon restaurant and it permeated all of our clothing  The bedroom window was bolted shut  so we couldnt get any fresh air into the room  With the amount that the Omni is charging for a room  they should have a much better ventilation system 
SFsBcsp7lH9fKOFxVVdb We enjoyed our stay at the James in Chicago very much  The hotel is elegant and uber modern  Each room simply exudes class  I have never stayed in a nicer hotel  to be honest  The hotel features an upscale restaurant  though it is within walking distance of many great dining establishments  There is also a full service spa at the hotel  The most surprising thing about the James is that pets are allowed our dog didnt have to stay at home  How cool is that There are also lots of up scale amenities like valet parking  24 hour room service  24 hour concierge  shoe shine service  and laundrydry cleaning  The hotel is located right on the Magnificent Mile  so that location is absolutely superb  You are literally steps away from some of the best dining and shopping in the world  I would recommend the James to anyone on business or looking to stay in upscale luxury on a jaunt to Chicago  
SRZS9ZA7kYBlE2H9j2Df I truly am not the sort of person to write a negative review about an establishment  but my time spent at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago forced me to do so  It was to be our first trip to Chicago since I was a boy so my wife and I were very excited to arrive and begin our short weekend getaway as soon as we checked into the hotel  First I must say that the counter help was far less than helpful  The apparently confused person who was to sign us in was extremely out matched when it came to the workings of the hotel computer and was total inept at customer service  He said we had not reserved a room  which I had weeks earlier  and proceed to explain to us that his hotel does not make mistakes of this kind and that WE must be mistaken as to the reservation or the hotel or both  Finally the manager arrived after I insisted on his presents  He did straiten out the confusion  but the room we were lead to was much smaller than we were lead to believe and had not even been cleaned from the last occupants  I called down to the front and demanded that the manager walk himself to our room and see the condition of the place  We were shown to another room  this time to our liking  From that point on nothing and no one that we saw or had contact with worked or acted as one would expect from a hotel with the reputation that the Affinia had  To list just a few the television was a 13 inch black and white which could get only 4 channels  the food that room service brought up was cold  lifeless and bland  the cleaning person knocked at our door at 5 in the morning every morning even with the Do Not Disturb sign on the door  and there was this ever so slight smell of mold and vomit which passed through the hallway every time my wife and I lift the room  To be blunt  I truly hope that the CEO of the company reads this note and fires the entire staff  guts the building thoroughly  and is publicly flogged in a downtown park  WE WILL NEVER STEP THROUGH THE DOORS OF THE AFFINIA AGAIN 
SciWQ4LMHLnpTtnPVFK5 We recently stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel for a week  The hotel was in a wonderful location and the service was great  We found all of the staff very helpful and prompt  We highly recommend the Intercontinental for any travel needs whether it be for business or pleasure  
SswtagEaAG40fI6eH7ZR The Chicago Hyatt Regency deceptively alters the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellation  ie the room cannot be cancelled  I recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel  The reservation specialist mentioned over the phone there was a 72 hour cancellation policy  However  when I tried to cancel the reservation within that timeframe  Robert  the reservation supervisor  said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room  He said that I should refer to the confirmation e mail that states at the bottom that prepayment is required at time of booking  non refunable  This clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone  I told him to cancel without being charged  In response  he threatened to cancel and charge me for the full stay  Why would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price The bottom line is the hotel deceptively changed the terms of the agreement  and Robert should go back to customer service school 
T1YCtYd5poWjxtlskOOw This was my first time in Chicago and I tell you they really made me feel like a million bucks  I took a taxi straight from the airport and was greeted at the door by a kind gentlemen who offered to help me with my luggage and assisted me to the check in counter  I made my way up to my room  which was spectacularly bright and well lit  then I ordered some food  All in all the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic  If I didnt have such a short stay in Chicago I would have stayed in my hotel room all day 
TBFlzZoPbY38Icr3alNR While staying at the Swissotel Chicago I experienced some of the worst customer service I have at any hotel  The front desk was extremely rude while checking out  and even seemed to try to hurry us out  The fitness center was always packed and I was never able to get on any of the machines  as was the pool area  While eating at the restaurant  I felt it was a very overpriced meal  but it was very elegant looking  The last issue I had with the hotel was the valet parking  it took them awhile to get my car  and they actually pulled the wrong car around  It was another 10 minutes while I waited for them to sort the issue out  The worst part by far was the customer service  and although the hotel looked nice  it wasnt worth the stay with the way I felt I was treated based on the money I was spending  Next time we are in Chicago  we will be staying somewhere else 
TOYC9oIQSAdJpuItV5LA My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Chicago last week in a studio suite  which was NOT worth the extra payment  It was an absolute NIGHTMARE  To begin with  the room is listed as oversized  when its nothing of the sort  Weve previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller  I believe the only extra space was in the closet  which isnt very useful unless you plan on living there  We had our two sons with us  so we had to make extra sleeping space  Our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time  complaining of bugs moving around  He must have been umcomfortable also  as I sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock  The room service is horrible  they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm  and she had to wait up for that  My family would NEVER go back to this hotel  and I highly recommend you also stay well away 
TeivrF8ygJAOeOT6V3Ua This is a great hotel  in a great location  in a great city     Theres a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part  The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rockers in the bathroom     I had the Beatles and although theyre not my cup of tea  I was happy enough with George staring back  me  The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants     try the Cheesecake Factory or have a meal  cocktail on the top floor of the John Hancock Centre  A slighty longer walk or a short cab ride and youre at the Navy Pier   take a ride on the Seadog then enjoy all the fun of the fair     or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music  This hotel  city is WELL worth checking out  
Tk9f1asxxC54KyrafYgu Awesome hotel  our room overlooked Michigan Ave and we could see the river  Very stylish  trendy room and hotel  Lacked a bit in amenities pool  etc but more than made up for it with the location and quality of the hotel  Booked it thought Hotwire for 99 which was awesome value  
TvLLrGaycN4MSdhe5Ofg me taking a cue from david dancer  sup front desk person  yes me  so  do I have to wait in the elevator line to get up to my room front desk person  what room are you in me   front desk person  oh     im afraid so  OR  you can take the other elevators and take the fire stairs up to the 10th floor  me  oh wtf  so  were staying at this hotel  and there is a bar on the 29th floor  but we have to wait 15 minutes in line to get to our fucking hotel room get bent  were paying to stay here  not just drinking in your bar 
U2MNBuh3ZGQ5QwHMUliH We stayed at Hotel Monaco and upgraded to a suite  I was disappointed with the room layout  and shabby furniture  I bumped into the coffee table and the top almost crashed to the ground  The make up mirror in the bathroom didnt work  the TV reception was very poor and overall the room just wasnt worth the 450 we spent there  Next time  we will go back to Trump Tower across the street  which is far superior to Hotel Monaco 
UOXi483xeFR3ESpTFIRZ While the hotel looked absolutely lovely from the outside  my experience went downhill once I walked in  The lighting is very poor  which creates such a dark and gloomy atmosphere  The mood was accompanied by less than friendly staff members who made our check in seem like nothing more than a huge hassle  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet night or a nice stay  I definitely would not stay here again 
UUtcWYXUaG7KwH1462e7 The Talbott Hotel is fantastic  I stayed there on business and found that it met my every need  The high speed internet access worked flawlessly allowed me to do much of my work from the comfort of my luxuriously appointed room  I really like to exercise before a day of meetings access to the fitness club next door was very convenient  Last point  I work for a green consulting firm out of L A  and the hotels environmental credentials dovetailed perfectly with our mission  Guilt free luxury 
UbUTAbfafAPWos8zmlq5 I was completely unfamiliar with Chicago but needed a place to stay while my husband worked there for a few days and we picked the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based solely on their internet site  Wow did I get lucky  This is a beautiful hotel with all of amenities I could have hoped for  terrific food  and within walking distance of several interesting places  including the Art Institute of Chicago  Ashley  at the concierge desk  was particularly helpful at guiding a Chicago newbie to the best places to eat ands to see  I will heartily recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers 
Ui2MvsHHgv8VuUh7qjcJ My husband and I made a reservation at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers  for a much needed weekend getaway  We took off work early Friday to beat traffic  Once at the hotel we quickly found out that there was not ample parking  We drove around several times looking for a space and had to park in an adjoining lot and walk across a busy side street to gain access to the hotel  Upon checking in we were informed that the floor  where our room was located  was in the process of having the carpets cleaned  We decided since we prepaid with our credit card that we were going to make the best of the situation  We took the elevator  which smelled like urine  up to our room  We did see some carpet cleaning machines  unattended  in the hallway  I hoped for the sake of safety  no children were staying on this floor  We walked into our room and my first thought was how much humidity was in the room and it seems one of the guest used the microwave to heat up some sort of spicy curry cusine  The overwhelming scent of burnt curry mixed with the chemical smell of the carpet shampoo were too much for us  We called the desk manager and asked if we could change rooms  He rudely informed us that the hotel was completely booked due to several weddings  Just then  the roar of the carpet cleaning machine came through the walls and I could not hear anything else my husband said  We decided to get a refund on our card and leave the hotel  It was an awful experience 
Uu0jx0OIkTQJSILaXOiO The service from check in to checkout was excellent   timely and efficient  The room was more then I has expected  It was spacious and laid out very well  I particularly enjoyed the living room area as well as the double closets and separate bath and shower  The bed abd pillows were extremely comfortable  I believe its the first time I stayed in a hotel that provided a toothbrush and toothpaste in the room  The location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go  I particularly enjoyed the excellent food at theChina Grill which is attached to the Hard Rock hotel  The service was very good and the staff very friendly  
V4cKO7oMaErDp6RECrff My stay here was superb  The view from my windows was stunning  as I looked out I could see the beautiful Grant Park  The room had a nice airy feel but was also warm and inviting  The bed was very comfortable  The wireless internet was fast and effective which is nice especially when on business trips  THe hotel is in walking distance to the museum which is nice for those on vaca  Overall I thouroughly enjoyed my stay here  
VQHITV3EleYLe8GvUcxO Stayed with a group for a bachelorette party  and was disappointed  The hotel is beautiful  the staff was all rather friendly  The main problem was the roomsleeping situation  We had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before  but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out how that happens I dont know   so they upgraded us to two suites with a king and a pull out  First  this meant our party was split up and on different floors  Second  that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch    Im not a picky  unreasonable person  but that was the WORST bed Ive ever slept on  It was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed  Then there were the springs poking into our backs ALL night  Just awful  For the amount of money we spent I expected to be comfortable  I would not stay here again after this experience 
VfFmUpav5jqEfdHvuH0f We experienced bed bugs in our room while staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel on the Magnificent Mile  We never received a return call from General Manager Sanjay Mahajan after several voicemails  We will never return to the hotel and will work to spread the word  We also heard from several employees from the cleaning staff that this is common in the hotel 
VrYdBAajGMF3Lp7t54IG We stayed at the Hard Rock for one night to do some intense  day after Thanksgiving shopping  It really is a great hotel  The rooms are really cool  and we were just in the basic one  The bed is extremely comfortable  with the softest sheets and great pillows  The technology in the room is great  They have nice upscale tolietries in the bathrooms  For a very modern room  it is still comfortable and homey  The location is perfect for getting wherever you want to go  The staff were very nice and helpful  The bar is really funky with an interesting martini menu  One of the best hotels I have stayed at in Chicago  Really enjoyed it and would highly recommend  
VzsltFU8YM9gaPhf3cJz I was initially excited when I found out that my employer was sending me to Chicago on business  but I could never have imagined the frustration and irritation that would be heaped on me by the inept staff of The James Chicago  When I arrived  my reservation could not be found in their system  although I had made it myself  After some words with the manager on duty  Mr  Chad Montgomery  I was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate  Anyone can make a mistake  so I wasnt too angry at that point  My room was bland and colorless  in spite of The James boasts of their attention to design and detail  The room was mostly clean  but after seeing the stains on the bedding  I am not convinced that they were washed after the rooms last occupant  I attended a stressful business meeting in The Dining Room that night  complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy  disgruntled waitstaff  Afterward I decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order  I was assured that I would enjoy Ashas Purifying Shower Ritual  which would primarily take place in my own room  The shower was okay  but I think I must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided  because I broke out in hives all over my body  Next came the in room portion  While I was in the shower  five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room  I guess they were supposed to make it smell good  but I began choking on the odor the minute I walked in the room  My masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion  but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking  I am sure certain areas are NOT on the massage menu  In closing  if you have ever considered staying at The James Chicago  I beg of you to reconsider  With only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel  and a suitcase full of negative including a pending court case against the masseuse  I can almost guarantee you would regret staying there  I know I do 
W6HE0SG5zEc7MBUgCaQQ This hotel is overpriced  One should pay money for luxury  but they fall far short considering the prices that they charge  When you go to the hotel restaurants you expect a certain mark up because  yes  they do have to make money  But the prices they charge for food that was okay makes little sense to me  When I got there and went to my room  I thought that there would be nice colors  a great view  and deluxe bedding  What I got were sheets that might have come from the full price section of target  they were not cheap  but not that expensive either  I think I could have found something of this quality at less than the 200ish a night I paid 
WFDFGLINXgTKG87bsEz9 This fantastic hotel has it all  luxury  an excellent location and a fun atmosphere  The rooms are spacious and well decorated  and the staff is always helpful and courteous  Whether youre traveling for business or fun  I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago  I stayed there with my wife recently  we were on a short weekend break and we wanted to enjoy the music an just have fun  The Hard Rock certainly delivered what we were looking for  The hotel is in a central location  within easy reach of the main tourist spots in the city  however  theres superb food on site and the best entertainment you could wish for  so theres barely a need to leave to hotel  well  we DID leave the hotel to see the sights  but you know what I mean  My wife and I particularly enjoyed the gym and spa facilities  including a relaxing massage  This hotel surpassed our expectations in every possible way  and well surely be staying there again the next time we visit the Windy City  
WNZltkky7l3BFKZ5qefr We booked the Amalfi looking for a great boutique hotel in Chicago  The hotel is a nice property with clean rooms and nice amenities in a good location  However  when i booked the hotel I was offered an upgraded room from a king room to a corner king room for only 10 more  That was great until I checked in  The corner room looked at two brick walls and an alley  During the night there were several homeless individuals fighting in the alley  It would seem that this is a place for them to congregate  On top of this  the dumpsters in the alley were being emptied by the waste department between 5 and 6 am in the morning  The noise was crazy loud  I think this is a nice hotel with some unfortunate aspects due to its location  The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful 
WbAje2WTEvkEZcQu40MM Didnt get the room we were promised  Kind of room we had reserved 2 queens wasnt available  they then squeezed 3 adult ladies into 2 singles and a blow up bed  Had to pile furniture on top of tables to get it in  Very unsatisfactory   Will not return  will not recommend  Will tell people going to Chicago to NOT stay in your hotel  When I next visit Paris nextspring  I intend to stop at your world headquarters to tell them what I think of the Chicago facility 
WsJa1kHuzrF32Dp3ZDPa First of all  Expedia com charged me for an additional person per my instructions but when I arrived at the Hotel these monies were not included and the complimentary breakfast was not offered  The Hotel service person who checked us in forgot to give me back my parking ticket but left a generic message for me stating that there was an envelope at the front desk  I had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to discover this the whole time this person was looking at me and never said a word   I was charged and paid for parking adjacent to the Hotel  When we went to leave the gate would not open  We had to find the parking garage office and the Manager had to call several times over to the Hotel until finally someone picked up  They confirmed my payment and then we were allowed to leave the structure  The Hotel itself is beautiful    The bell hops and doormen were just wonderful  They were more than helpful and gracious but the internal staff were rude and not helpful at all    
X7tnp3zfCigfCvxyb589 We had reservations guaranteed by credit card for 2 nights this past weekend  When we checked in the clerk told us that they could not accommodate us for both nights because they were overbooked due to a conference in town  I asked them to relocate us for both nights so that we would not have to move in the morning  They sent us over to another location that they assured could accommodate us  The night manager gave us the address to a different hotel and sent us on our way  Eventually we arrived at the correct second hotel where the staff were expecting a letter from the Sheraton for the transfer   something we were never given  Eventually we checked into this second property and the next afternoon when our keys didnt work we found out that the night manager of the Sheraton had not assured that we could stay both nights at the second hotel  So once again we had no place to stay despite having a guaranteed reservation with the Sheraton  In addition to all of this  we had to pay 24 for parking at the Sheraton to find out that they would not accommodate us despite a guaranteed reservation  I am still shocked by this bad experience 
XMXr2nQd3OUsbhqAXJGK Got a great deal through Hotwire for 70 a night but if I ever return to Chicago I would definitely stay again  even at full price  We really liked the rooms muted modern decor  we had John Lennon and Bono for company  Comfortable bed  mini coffe maker  plenty storage space and a lovely  clean bathroom stocked full of Aveda products so I was sold straight away   it doesnt take much  I know   If youre a product junkie  tip the maid and request some extra bottles and you will leave with lots of goodies   We liked the location and had a great view down N Michigan Ave  found the staff to be really friendly and relaxed reception  gift shop and bar  The bar area is very trendy  I liked the chilled atmosphere which surprised me cause I normally find these types of bars a bit too pretentious for my liking   the lack of memorabilia didnt bother me but I was more interested in the art deco features of the building itself anyway  The only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh  and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a friendly lady looking for business when he was at the bar  I think its a place you will either love or hate  if you like laid back  contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you  
XXNXPHNFuXnVvTm3QMbV I recently stayed at the Amalfi Chicago with my wife on a business trip  We decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded  We enjoyed the luxurious in room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city  The individualized attention from check in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service  The Amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more  Our weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site  The hotels design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses  Lots of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable  Breakfast is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt  Being of European descent  I enjoyed the croissants  whole grain muffins  real butter and marmalade  We also brought along our Standard Poodle  Sterling  and the Amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family  We purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed Sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings  Sterling slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling at home while away  For pet lovers this is a big plus  Finally  transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal  This allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this  another appreciated bonus of our stay  Thank you Amalfi for a superb experience  
XdOoZnY1PpizhjpRAfd0 My husband and me reserved a room online for the Chicago Hilton  We were looking for a quit few days away from home and work  Unfortunately what we found was not what we were looking for  First of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos  The floors looked like they havent been cleaned in a while in the check in area  The room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side  The staff was horrible  We had asked for a turn down service it was never received  I would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone  Chicago is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the Hilton 
XlppEbeW38dCSONiZ1l7 After recent week stay at the Affinia Hotels  I can definitely say i will be coming back  They offer so many in room amenities and services  Just a very comfortable and relaxed place to be  My most enjoyable experience at the Affinia Hotel was the amazing customization they offered  I would recommend Affinia hotels to anyone looking for a nice place to stay  
Y79M6fEEdR11l2Uvijo7 We stayed in the Amalfi in July 2010  4th of July weekend  I was very apprehensive about leaving my Diesel Ford Excursion with the valet at Amalfi  It has a few modifications to the engine and can be damaged if not operated correctly  I explained the procedure to the valet drivers  and felt like it was a complete waste of time  When the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as I had instructed  When I tried to start it  it wasnt happy  but did finally start  I was so relieved to get it back I just wanted to leave  Driving away I noticed that the top speed recorded on the GPS was 105mph    previous top speed was 95mph  done a few days earlier driving across South Dakota  I could just picture the flying Ferrari scene in Ferris Buellers Day Off  I couldnt imagine where in the crowded Chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast  though it wouldnt take long to make that happen see reference to modified engine above  A little while later we stopped for lunch and I noticed a dent in the front bumper  I contacted the hotel and was referred to their claims people  No remedy  Lesson learned  Brett
YDMplkk8zWMDBPzAEOXr My husband and I stayed at The Palmer House Hilton last month to celebrate our anniversary  What a wonderful hotel   We had such a great weekend  largely thanks to The Palmer House  Every amenity we could want was right there at the hotel  at our fingertips  And the location is perfect  right in downtown Chicago  We stayed in one of their one bedroom king suites  It was exquisite  so elegant and beautiful  It was easily the most luxurious suite we have ever stayed in  The service was impeccable  Every employee we encountered was both pleasant and eager to accomodate any need we expressed  We had our anniversary dinner at the Lockwood Restaurant in the hotel  It was delicious  We will definitely return to the Palmer House Hilton for our next special weekend getaway  
YHl7CXN4Aj2uu7fKiscl The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was everything you could ask for in a hotel  It was meticulously clean  very orderly  but still perfectly warm and comforting  The rooms are very big and spacious  and the beds are so soft  its like heaven  I didnt test out the room service  but Im sure it would be just like everything else    perfect The hotel staff are just so nice  There was a spectacular view from my room  and looking out over the city at night is so magical  There are resturants that are easy to access from the hotel  and I especially recommend Shulas Steak House  Overall  I had a fantastic stay at The Sheraton Hotel  and I would definitely stay there again 
YWusBbzudfSKDWMly1Mk My stay at the Amalfi was a very brief one  I booked the hotel based on all of the glowing reviews I saw here on Trip Advisor  When I arrived  I sat down at a desk with an amazingly aloof clerk  I felt like I stepped into an episode of the Twilight Zone  The room was very small and dark  Then the Internet wasnt working  I wasnt informed about this on my check in and couldnt be given a time frame when it would be back up  I walked the neighborhood and found another hotel more to my liking  gathered up my belongings and went there  If youre one of those people who likes trendy upscale and chi chi locations and hotels  youll lurve this place  But if you like a hotel with lights on  working internet and a good view and real breakfast  go someplace else 
YgUjVuF0dITm6gl9bqu5 The atmosphere at this hotel is truly remarkable it has a very modern feel  The rooms were very well designed  and the beds are not your average hotel room beds by any means  The pillow top beds made an already relaxed and comfortable stay that much more enjoyable  
YnjGKf63FeuoW0ewBTWR My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at the Ambassador East Hotel  We will never stay at this hotel again  For the steep price we paid to stay there  we expected a friendly staff and clean room  which we did not get  First of all  the rooms are not clean  We found a few bugs in our room and the sheets did not look like they have been recently changed  When we reported this information to the hotel staff  they did not do anything to help us out  The staff is very unfriendly  Also  there were no clean towels to use in the bathroom 
Yr0MgjZWRwVZWUJrSMsQ Very pleasant front staff  wine in the evening in the lobby  large rooms  great rates  and free Internet for those that are members of the loyalty program  Overall an excellent value  Close to the El for those coming in from either Midway or OHare airports  
Z3Mm9EglgGo1FDebjdLZ Going to the Internet Retailer 2010 at the last minute and this was the only hotel left available with shuttle services  First of all  from reading other reviews  now I know I got ripped  249 a night when Priceline folks are sniping these rooms for 79 albiet  I got free wifi  The hotel is nice but it can only get so nice for an oldie   no matter how much money you dump into it  Shower head was really low Im 61  water pressure was low  It is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by check out reviews on Yelp  For some off reason I ended up with two double beds they asked me a few times if I was traveling alone  If traveling here  1   make sure you get a better deal than I did 2   confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3   Dont have super high hopes My room was neither up to par as a business class although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor nor was it a good fit for the romantic couple   it wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers sp trying to save money 
Z3yEN6BwnFuqRTW4Kf6Q If you want to stay in a fabulous hotel in the city and youre willing to pay a little extra  Id recommend this place Also  pay the extra for a corner room   the views of the city are spectacular A short walk to Michigan Avenue  Excellent service from the valets  concierge  lobby agents  and waitstaff in the restaurants  The food in the restaurants was great and room service wasnt too shabby either Well worth the money  
ZORHgcbBIW6Ubnum5w6r Any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth  eventually the lodging deteriorates  But you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time  I have been staying at the Talbott for several decades  Yes  changes have been made  like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance  most recently  But other things have gone downhill  For the last several stays I have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service  Rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions  This is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of The Talbott  but not this less than maintained lodging  I  personally  am shopping for a new home away from home 
ZZS41s0ham9QdxOGg7ZB I choose the Homewood Suites in Downtown Chicago because I called them directly in search of a two bed room within walking distances of the attractions of Chicago  Well  when we arrived  it was apparent that there was chaos do to one of two elevators being out of service which it had been since Tuesday  this was Saturday  Once we finally got to the 6th floor to check in  I figured our relaxing time had begun  Well  we got our room key and headed for the17th floor  Again  waited for an elevator but finally made it two our room  I put the key in the door it opened to the surprise of me and the family already inside the room   Yup we got double booked  The family was very nice and seemed OK with their surprise visitors  Said our apologies and went back to the elevator and waited again to head back down to the 6th floor registration to figure the mess out  We have now been at the hotel for a half hour with no room and slightly annoyed  Made it to the reservation desk and explained the situation  I did get an apology and a new room  New key in hand waited AGAIN for an elevator to bring us to the 9th floor for a new room  FINALLY got to our room only to find it was a king suite  We are a family of four including two full grown teenage boys  There was no way they were going to fit on a pull out sofa  So  REALLY annoyed now  I called the front desk and was told that were no rooms with two beds left even though I had specifically asked for two beds when I booked  It said two beds on preference on my reservation but the reservation agent assured me two beds would be available when I checked in  She went so far to but TWO BEDS on my reservation paper work  The operator said there are is only one two bed room on each floor  The only thing we got was a fold up bed that took away half the room in the living area  Now  I paid a total of 349 00 for one night for this room  We got the mess mentioned above and a breakfast out of the deal  I am pretty sure my next trip to Chicago will not include this hotel  I can tell you that we are frequent HWSHilton customers but this hotel will not be on our list of stops in the future 
Zn8vbRC7nCosJ8FqEE3k I chose to stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel during a recent trip to Chicago because I had heard they had good reviews  Boy  were these reviews wrong   I had terrible service from the moment I walked in the doors  I was not greeted by the receptionist  it was like I wasnt even there  My room was NOT ready for me when I got there  even though I got there AFTER my required check in time  then once I was allowed to go to my room  it was filthy  It was as if they didnt even clean it  so I dont know what the hold up was  There were no towels  shampoo or soap in the bathroom  The worst part was that there were bugs in the tub  The place was the most disgusting place Ive ever been to  and it is supposed to be one of the nicest  It should be the nicest for the price they charge  I do not recommend staying here  Stay at your own risk  
Zyoc5fc3o9aai7qDrx2C Hyatt Regency Hotel  Good ole Downtown  Chicago  Hypo allergenic rooms are usually intended for the well being of even the worst cases of allergen sufferers  Well  when we got to our room  one of the first things my wife did was sneeze four times  Upon setting up the channel scanning which  the reception came in fuzzy all around  there was an interattive ethernet feature that after  lost in confusion of how to work it  provided us with our first fee  The pool was in bad shape  The maids seemed to come and go with no intercommunicative qualities   just knock knock knock  We let em right in as they started vacuuming  One of the fluorescent bulbs on the ceiling was dimmer than the others and the Gideons Bible had crib notes  What a room  Not to mention what the hotel was like  Oh geez 
aGCRJmYbMzt8paG4HVBC This hotel does not belong in the same league as The Peninsula  Four Seasons  or Ritz Carlton  It was more like staying at an overpriced W Hotel  Staff was very nice and attentive  but the lobby is cramped  and only two small elevators for 17 floors   Several times the elevator was full by the time it reached our floor  and we were forced to take the stairs  The hotel must be flooding the travel websites itself with high reviews 
aQPg6qXmPxNGmzDR2gGO We chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less crowds  We anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel  than some of the other larger high rise hotels  We did not experience very good service at the Talbott Hotel  When we checked Irena seemed very robotic and aloof  The front desk clerks were neither welcoming nor gracious  The lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door  Each time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff  just a blank stare and gaze  The front desk staff was chilly and stiff  no greetings  no smiles and no personality  They had difficulty answering simple questions or requests  On the other hand the bellman Perry was great  He was sociable and very service oriented  He was aware of what is going on in the area  He recognizes the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area  and where to eat in the neighborhood  He is authentic and he even asked us upon our return how was that restaurant Tim the concierge was also supportive  He gave us 10 discount coupons for shopping at the major department stores  We had the largest suite  We requested a rollaway extra charge when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after 10PM  When the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed  What made our Talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned  We were out of our room from 8AM and when we returned to our room at 4PM the rooms had not been cleaned  We called the front desk to ask to send someone  The maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening  The room itself was pleasant  It did have a moldy smell and some Frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much  We were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin  We really liked staying in this area of Chicago but expected first rate service  The service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel 
aYHveUa5OE9RxQK6enPj The Swissotel is totally understaffed and lacking any charm or atmosphere  It was clean  comfortable and had great views but if you wanted to check in  use the concierge  check out  or report a problem to the front desk  forget about it  I booked this place through Priceline COM so I cant complain too much as I didnt pay a lot for the room but I have stayed at 4 star hotels in the past as well as another Swissotel  It left a lot to be desired  The minibar fridge in my room didnt work so forget about a cold beer  Also  the internetmovieguest services console didnt work so I had to go to the business office to access the internet  When it was time to checkout the console still wasnt working  Its better than the Holiday Inn but way below expectations for a 4 star hotel
ajmBXI8pM4qghnSGT15m Did not enjoy my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel  Firstly  the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful  There was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle  Secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out  the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees  Considering I paid well over 250 per night for the Romance package reservation  it was below my standards and I will not be heading back to the Omni Chicago Hotel any time soon 
awLMXQCaDHQVx55fduXV Very Very noisy   Constant water running through pipes  It was terrible   There are much better hotels to stay at in Chicago  Thier parking rate is obnoxious 42 00 a night and way too far out to walk to much  If you must stay here  try to park for free on dead end street feed meter on weekdays and take the stairs down to the next street level and you will find a Jewel grocery store for sodassnacks  A can of soda at the hotel was 4 50 plus 18 restocking fee  
bC1d9j43L9nLBOFz9KCV I was really excited when we booked a night at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago  It was actually beyond our budget  but my husband and I needed a weekend away  so I decided to splurge for the occasion  WORST WASTE OF MY MONEY EVER    Our room was smaller than pictured online  and it looked like the maid didnt vacuum the carpet  We visited the hotel restaurant  Angels and Kings  one night for dinner and the drinks were overpriced and my husbands steak was cooked wrong he ordered medium  but received a well done steak  By the end of our trip we were so glad to leave  but they were under staffed and the Sunday morning checkout line was so long that we waited in line for 30 minutes until we could check out  Chicago was a fun city  but next time we return Ill be choosing a different hotel   and I suggest you do too  
bHUu8JxgZOeU71th5dZo Whats not to like    Problems getting the room you actually reserved  I had to call this hotel three times and email four times in order to insure that we actually got the room we had reserved     Overcharging  They charge for everything here  Wireless  The Fitness Center  The Business Center  Ive only run into one other hotel that ever charged for use of the fitness center  Note to the Intercontinental  If youre going to charge for something that is commonly included  you should advertise that fact  Whats next Charging for sheets on the bed    Very poor customer service  The staff does not communicate in full sentences  or wait to hear your answer  This is Chicago  not New York  How about a little Midwestern patience
bU3iRNyVcUpMgRznpxdp Fantastic Hotel  Upscale and luxurious  and in a great location  Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff goes out of their way to treat guests like royalty  The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean  the beds are comfortable and even the bathrooms were to die for  My husband and I had a great time in the lounge and enjoyed many of the amenities  I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone  and cant wait to get back there myself 
bYXSaXc8wvcDe0W415O7 The hotel is beautiful  It is an excellent location  There was a few minor issues  The hotel is clearly geared toward the convention and business crowd  There were charges for almost everything  although I did not incur any of these  Our room was a little small for the class of hotel  but not overwhelmingly small  Not a true complaint  but the elevators were very slow  My comparison was that we stayed in an equally aged hotel in a different city during our trip  and the Intercontinentals were significantly slower  Thats it  no more little nit picks  The staff was excellent  the doormen being the highlight  The hotel bar was also very nice  The hotel was immaculately clean  I would definitely travel to this hotel again  
biqZTrnQWOjUOSfgxvlW First let me say wonderful   My wife and i were refered this Hotel by a friend  After traveling to Chicago many time we have had many experiences good and bad with different hotels  We were amazed with the Knickerbocker  we felt like royalty from our first step on the property  Everyone was willing to make our stay rememberable  This Hotel made a routine trip to Chicago a dream Vacation  I can not wait to return   
bp4XLAhsy2bm8ZGVUbML I would not stay at this hotel again  The rooms had a fowl odor  It seemed as though the carpets have never been cleaned  The neighborhood was also less than desirable  The housekeepers seemed to be snooping around while they were cleaning the rooms  I will say that the front desk staff was friendly albeit slightly dimwitted 
bxfcTaEsOxVNhOHmOztB We brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time  Small rooms  but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene  Lots of interesting amenities in the room  Convenient to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping  Really loved the lobby    a great place to hang around or wait for someone  Lots of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere  Watch out  The concierge like all concierges at big hotels will direct you to mediocre  large restaurants where they get kickbacks  We have stayed here several times and I always check for rooms here when I travel to Chicago  However  the hotel is often full so book early  
cAedZtXlBM447BrfG1bz We were greeted by staff with excellent customer service skills  Our room was such a pleasant surprise  from the flat screen TV  the full size shower with rain showerhead  hand held shower wand  the wall attached toilet with flushing options on the wall  the comfortable bed  the lovely lighting options  etc   The size of the room was snug  and very comfortable  as would be  in a historic hotel  It was also quiet  and I know that the hotel was sold out  My sister was in the room next door  We did not hear her TV  We also loved walking less than a block  to the shopping and restaurants on North Michigan Avenue  
cdP0bdHMCiIzizBAVDTY We booked our hotel stay thru Yahoo and requested a room for 4 with 2 beds  When we got to the hotel  not only did they not have a room for us we pre paid   but they said they could not guarantee what we had requested online  they could only give us what was available  The hotel staff was rude and condescending and only after I got upset did they finally tell me they did have a room for us  If you book online   beware  You may not get what you paid for  They did not stand by their promise they advertise in each room 
cjUD8cE2KwIn1WvnrjFj Stayed here for two days in the first week in January  when hotel was very quiet  Got a big corner room  Staff are friendly  decor is modern  and theres a huge choice of pastries and cakes and breads for breakfast  which you take back to your room  The free hors doevres with the drinks are great antipasti   olives  breads  cheeses and meats  marinated vegetables  This was a really easy hotel to stay in  fairly central   a couple of blocks away from the L  and quiet  despite the building work opposite  If youre in Chicago  stay here  
ctyRbsg7sCwZJFHnAoMJ My husband and I arrived at the Swissotel Chicago to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary  We automatically thought our experience would be nice because the pictures on the website and the hotels brochure intrigued us  Boy were wee wrong  Upon arrival at the given and advertised check in time our room was not ready  We waited for more than an hour  with our bags in hand  We checked more than twice to see if the room was ready  but the staff was less than warm both times  After a few frowns and mumbles from the people at the desk in the hotels lobby  tired and finally arriving to our room  we expected to take a nap and hit the city  We reserved the premier Corner King or so we thought  We were supposed to be able to see the lakes and rivers and the skyline  Yeah  right  All we saw were the brick side of the other side of the building  In addition  the water in the shower had little pressure  We called the front desk  the phone rang for 21 times before someone answered  My husband said that he thinks that they knew we were the people calling  We requested a better room  but they said that none was available  However  they did have an upgraded room  but we would have to pay some sort of upgrade fee  We could not believe it  My husband felt that we should not agitate them any further  for fear that they might make things even worse for us  like turn off our air  We threw on some more jeans and headed fro the coffee shop around the corner that had given us refuge before  After returning about 2 hours later  the water pressure was fixed  The room was clean and the bed was plush  but the overall experience especially the rudeness of the staff was not good  Lets just say that on our next 13th anniversary we wont stay at the Swissotel and will tell others to not stay there 
czybREtiR3TEWXw4dOYd Conrad Chicago it was 5 00 AM my plan just flew in and I was tired I checked myself into the Confad Chicago when I first got there there was a creepy employe the floor was filthy but I got my room in the 5th level of then as I dashed towards the elevator my suite case in hand I entered it then thats where I started to see the beauti of the place the walls where polished wood there was even a small ACheater unit and it was good  Then out of no where Ting I made it up there this place was great the carpets where velveteen it was a true luxurious hotel I found my rooms and was greeted to a golden door nob I was living in paradise after I got into my room it was a perfect  The room was a perfect 68 degrees  I was shocked to find how confrotable the bed was    perfect  And it had leather pillows and a huge blanket then just when I didnt think it could get any better I look my bathroom its perfect stone and gold  The water actually has a good taste to it like grapes I was so shocked I fell uncontentious I was drowning cause my face fell into the toilet then I woke up you wont believe how fast the assistance will save your life there  I when t back up into my floor and guess what I say out the windows a swimming pool and it was huge Olympic sized swimming pool It was great  I got on my beach suit and went down there and it was heated over all I dont think I can leave and all of the other swimmers where pretty nice rich people and they where alright though a little big stuck up but not too much  Then came dinner time perfect  I must say I am extremely satisfied with my visit  Time to fly back to where I cam from and then my plan took off im going to miss that hotel 1010 
dCZJGoHJCSbSVSisdXgD The hotel was very nice Service was great  everyone was very friendly  The room was very elegant and classy  The bed was so comfortable  The room also had a flat screen TV and Bose sound system  Not bad  Overall I had a great experience with a pleasant staff and perfectly comfortable room  I left here well rested and happy  
dSQqT7sbeITInl5OITE9 Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay  This hotels five star rating needs a downgrade  When I visited this hotel 14 years ago  The Fairmont was among the classiest brands  No more  My 29th floor room was expansive  but dark    only one small window and one light was not working  The upholstery was frayed  the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water  and the rooms door didnt close unless you pulled on it in a certain way  Worse  the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you  with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser  It was like sleeping in an old vending machine  but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message  there was none to be found  Other reviewers remarked that this hotel needs updating  but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame  For instance  someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations  I couldnt sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open    the space wouldnt accommodate my legs  I am not unusually tall  There are so many great hotels in Chicago that deserve five stars  that the Fairmont shouldnt be able to compete  See my profile for better ideas  Niftyc
dk5tQrtCM1en5ZAVXCAN We just got back from a trip to Chicago for my 30th birthday and we could not have been more impressed by this hotel  Service was excellent  especially the maid service  Our room was so clean and fresh towels brought in daily  The front desk staff was some of the most professional and friendly staff I have ever dealt with while travling  The location is excellent as it is within walking distance of the best restaurants and stores  I highly recommend Affinia for a the perfect family vacation 
e55gWmN5ULtNypgCpgYJ My husband and I stayed overnight at the Affinia  Prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel not true  Since it was a very special occasion  and also because we were only staying overnight  we didnt let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend  However  this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences  Ive ever had  First  the smells  The linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy  The odors were not mild  and I found it pretty repulsive  I couldnt wait to jump out of bed in the morning  to get away from the odors  Hard to sleep and certainly didnt want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary  I didnt discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed  At that point  I chose not to contact housekeeping because a I was exhausted  and b I didnt want to upset my husband  who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing  Also  the bathroom smelled like vinegar  Perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by Affinia  but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did  Incidentally  the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days not a well maintained property  Second  the elevators  If you stay above the first few floors  there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop c view bar  With so many floors to service  and so many people going up to the c view bar on a saturday  these elevators took forever to come  and were often full they did  Annoying  Also  on one occasion  there were several bottles water and soda left in the elevator clearly  the maintenance crew doesnt inspect and clean the common areas frequently  Finally  and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived  First  when we booked  we asked for as quiet a room as possible  The hotel is located near Northwestern Memorial Hospital  But  its proximity to Michigan Ave   and the lack of accomodations elsewhere due to the Transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same week end  led us to stay here anyway  At check in  the clerk noted our request  and said our room was quiet room since it was not next to the elevators  When we arrived at our room  we discovered that we were across from the elevators  Obviously  she was technically correct that we werent next to the elevators  but it was still so close 15 20 feet that we could hear the elevator noise  Also  since it was a special occasion  we asked if we could upgrade  The disingenuous  snarky  condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade  Clearly  the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels  this is a matter of routine  not exception  Pretty awful experience all the way around  Other reviewers must have very low expectations  Cant explain any of the good reviews otherwise 
eGQKSzkanAkIlKIos6gh We booked a room at the Hilton Chicago for two nights to stay the weekend  but upon arrival our reservation could not be found  I even provided the hotel with our confirmation number  but it still wasnt available  Fortunately  another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us  Once we settled into our room for the night after a long flight  there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom  Apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re clean it after our arrival  Needless to say  with both of these poor experiences in just one night  I will be hesitant to EVER stay in this hotel again  let alone any other Hilton around  Please consider someplace else before the Hilton Chicago 
eYyzyKOFune3cXKFh83U This hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of the city of Chicago  It is ideal for the corporate executive  Not only in terms of location but the hotel offers a spectacular view of the ocean  The dining room is spacious and makes eating at this hotel a really pleasant experience  While dining the guest experiences a nice ambiance as they overlook the city  which is picturesque especially at night  when the city lights come on  The rooms are nice and spacious and allows the guest to get all their work done with a desk area  I would strongly recommend this hotel for the corporate executive 
eps3TfYeLqwqNEbznZHo The Swissotel Chicago is a delight to visit  Located in downtown Chicago this hotel has nine different styles of room accommodations to serve everyones taste  They have children friendly rooms as well as the exquisite presidential suite  Rooms have exceptional views of downtown Chicago  This hotel also has a penthouse fitness center and pool for entertainment  Other places to stop by to eat is the Palms  Geneva and the Lobby Lounge 
et3rntWPrLSocqKKcPCT Let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 5 6 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis not including our business travel  Weve traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail  We were not at all impressed by this hotel  At 220night we were expecting a decent  clean hotel but obviously not a 5  We were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given 1546  The paintwallpapertub were peeling  there was hair in both the tubtoilet when we got to the room  the internet service was extremely slow  the toilet ran throughout the night  and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in  We told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was I know  we cant wait for our renovations  If it hadnt been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the UK  booked into this hotel by a travel agent  we would have checked out as soon as we checked in  Let me also add that the front desk seemed short staffed as the check incheck out process was painfully slow  All we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendlyresponsive door staff  In its day this was likely a lovely hotel  but it is in dire need of a renovation  Despite its location I cannot understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a sub par experience  We would never book at this hotel again 
ezftiBVSCAlSp7gm2Nfa When I went to The James hotel in Chicago I truly expected a luxury experience exactly like what they were advertising  Gorgeous chairs  staff at the desk focusing on their job  and a clean  well decorated hotel room  Much to my  and my wallets dismay I found quite the opposite  I arrived to the hotel late after my flight was delayed  and found the clerk reading a magazine  It must have been a fascinating article  as it took him a full minute to look up and ask if I had a reservation  or would be making one  I said I had one  and gave him the voucher Id printed out  He checked it  and said that all the single rooms had already been rented out  he went on to say that I would have to pay extra for a two or three person room if I wished to stay the night  I grudgingly accepted the two person option as the jet lag was setting in and I desperately needed to get some sleep  The clerk offered to walk me to my room  saying I looked tired and trying to navigate the hotel would be much easier after I got some sleep  I accepted  and followed him to my new room  He carried the briefcase I had with me  but it was not apparent why at the time as I had both hands free  He ushered me into my room  setting the briefcase down inside  and said if I needed anything that the phone next to the bed would give me a direct line to room service without having to dial anything  I thanked him and closed the door  It was then that I looked around and fully saw where I was staying  What was supposedly a two person suite was two twin beds 6 apart  covered in ruffled blankets and sheets  The cleaning staff had obviously not been in here recently  A quick look around the other areas and I found the bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap  not even the complementary ones were left behind  I got ready for bed  and looked around for the TV remote  which it turned out  had no batteries in it  Instead  I just turned out the lights and rolled over  sheets and blanket turned inside out to try and find a cleaner option  In the morning I walked down to the lobby and asked to check out  Id had enough of the hotel after one night  The clerk that morning was a cheerful blond who cheerfully asked me my room number and handed me a bill  240 for my room  and an extra 80 with a note about a baggage service  I asked her about it  and she said if anyone carried my bags to my room for me it was filed under the baggage service  I asked if it was considered reasonable to charge 80 for carrying a suitcase to a room two floors up  and riding the elevator  and she said it was unusual  but not unheard of  She offered to change it to a mere 20 and handed me a slip with a phone number  name  and reason for the disagreement  saying that the manager would handle any complaints between the clerk and I after I signed it  I did so  and left  my wallet 260 lighter  and my head throbbing with a headache from lack of sleep 
f2tq9g8Y4weinaoMrdO1 This hotel had a great location  but you can do much better for the money  The hallways smelled of smoke  dirty elevators  furniture in the lobby was thread bare  The staff was very helpful  The room was large  bed comfortable but the room was so musty and old smoke lingered  If you have any allergies dont stay here 
fKAxWLKgCY8zPTeZL8lo Booked a room online and got a great rate under 200 which is very cheap for a summer hotel room in Chicago in this nice location  3 blocks I think from the water  Even though our rate was so cheap  the service was wonderful  the front desk were polite cheerful  the doormen and valet were great and helpful  and they even put a fridge in our room when we requested on  free of charge  The fitness room was clean  large and provided fruit and clean towels  and it had the greatest view of the city as it was on the top floor of the hotel  Location of hotel is safe  and such a beautiful area  Check the rates directly online of the hotels website  as it was the least expensive  We will stay here again for sure  
fb42bBxVNhvAor7ixYmC I stayed at the InterContinental in Chicago for my visit to set up my Daughters wedding  Nina Our Daughter stated this was the place where all the higher echilon gets hitched  Well I dont understand why at all  Upon arrival we checked in and met Nina at the The Bar how innovative and had a light supper  The food was like airline food and cold  The waiter was annoying and in your face when he could clearly see we were not ready to have our food taken yet  When he finally came with the check we thought our light supper was all too pricey  Then we were supposed to meet the sales manager Erin in the Lobby at 8 00 PM sharp  Not sharp enough  At 8 15 a worker came over to us and stated that Erin had an emergency and wouldnt be able to meet with us tonight  Well that is just great  Over 300 for a night and supper that would obviously be wasted  No more money will be spent here  I will Guarentee that  Sincerely Mr  and Mrs  Scott Grander Louisville  KY
fgsa3qky4gXsvPQpivN7 The room wasvery tiny and was very warm  They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do  The bathroom is small  The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review  and does crackle under your feet  I  personally  did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality  The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in  This is basically an old hotel that has been updated  The comment about the closet is true  it is actually indescriable  You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms  The location is convienent but so are many other hotels  If you do stay  fly into Midway  take the Orange Line  you cannot go wrong 
fmTEdm94TmiRRtbOSZrk I want everyone to know about the awful experience I had at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers  When we arrived at the hotel  the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system I had called earlier in the day and confirmed it  After speaking to the on duty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked  We later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically  I believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money  I for one wont be going back to this hotel 
frSghZCrui1FIm5MsehX My family and I stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in July  08  We had 3 1 bedroom suites  Great Location in downtown Chicago  Within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions  The service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly  The breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded  I recommend going early  The rooms were quiet and clean  I highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying 2 3 days  We would stay here again  Parking is expensive  about 28day  It is valet  The cheapest self parking I could find in the area was 24days so we did valet parking  The valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly  This is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites 3 different cities  I have had a great experience each time  
g1rq6B5mhGGtK4Je9a0b I went here with the family  including our dog MarleyThey are very pet friendly  We really enjoyed it  This place is huge with over 480 rooms and suites and is in the center of downtown close to shopping and entertainment  It also seems that it would be a great place to have a wedding or to host an event  I will definately be coming back next time I need to come to chicago definately a fine four star hotel 
gFfakpzlRadCxAi3WnDR The hotel is excellently situated for visiting The Art Institute or Millennium Park  It is an old classic of a hotel  and the main lobby is a must see  but I would not stay there again  The problem with any hotel dating from long ago the current one was built in 1923 25 is that  even with extensive remodeling which was done in 2007 2009 it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today in many cases the walls are load bearing so cannot be changed too much  We had a reasonably sized room king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries  Also  there was no coffee machine in the room   something I have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days  My major complaint about this stay was the Executive Lounge  It is usually worth while to pay the extra for access   in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors doeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price  Since we are currently at the diamond level in the Hilton Honors program  we get access for free at the Hiltons but I usually upgrade at other chains such as the Hyatt  At the Palmer Executive Lounge I ordered a couple of glasses of wine there was a bartender on duty and was slightly surprised by the cost   9glass which came to 21 44 for two with tax and tip   and was even more surprised by the wine  It was about the worst wine I had tasted in many years  I didnt think it was even as good as Trader Joes cheapest 2 99 wine that I tried a couple of weeks ago  Unfortunately I didnt get a look at the bottle to see what it was although I did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard  I noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in   and I can understand iot at the prices they were charging  It then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time  I checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass   the same three varietals as at the bar  The cabernet was a William Hill at 10 50glass from room service  I presume that what I had had at some time been a William Hill that had been left to turn to vinegar  It was slightly more expensive from room service  but I hope that it was in a lot better condition 
gcV17Fr0uRjhcWtBAeRs We booked thru hotwire which we have a high percentage of positive outcomes  I was very happy when we saw that we would be staying at The Knickerbocker as I had stayed when I was younger  We reserved a King Non Smoker  Upon arriving we were told that they did not have that and we only had the choice of a Smoking room  When argued they stated well you booked thru hotwire so you do not have priority  As we entered the room I noticed the bathroom door was off track and the bathroom light did not turn on  We called the front desk and they fixed the door but not the light  Later that eveing as I took a shower the seal around the shower was so poor water got all over the floor and towels  Also  I must add the room reaked of smoke  The next day when we checked the front desk clerk asked how our stay was and when we told him the problems  he told us the total and had not concern of our issues  We also checked in our bags for the day  and the bellmen came quickly and made very rude comments about us hurrying up so he could get on with his day  We realized a bit later that we forgot something in one of the bags and was told they would not get them back out  STAY AWAY even if you get a good deal  
gpQ94JAhy00IuPueVSqt The Talbott Hotel was very classy  professional  and luxurious  I loved how the staff was nice and respectful  I was treated like i was royalty when i was there  when in checked i was greeted by all of the people working behind the front desk and was offered a tour of the hotel  They took my bags and put them in my room while i was taking the tour and they even escorted me to my room right after we were done  This is a very nice and modern looking and their rooms are spacious and clean unlike other hotels in their area  I have recommended this hotel to all of my family and friends and would recommend it to anyone who is going to stay in that area  
gtfe1fPpB08Ild0LqgPp Very beautiful hotel  The historic features of this hotel make it absolutely amazing  This hotel offers many great guest accommodations of which I enjoyed the spacious  tidy rooms  The staff here are very friendly  helpful  and professional  The concierge went out of her way to make sure we knew about the area and not just what was in the hotel  I especially enjoyed the service at The Lockwood Restaurant here  Our server was excellent and the food was delicious  I must say this hotel exceeded my expectations  All in all  my stay was awesome 
h3MxKIQwRohCKDuFRtac We were hungry and tired when we checked into the Chicago Sheraton  The nice clerk at the front desk got us checked in efficiently and with a warm smile  He made us dinner reservations at Shulas giving us time to shower and change and arranged for a bellhop to take our bags up to the room for us   what service   We enjoyed our steaks and the bottle of wine that was recommended by the waiter at Shulas   truly a lovely meal  When we returned to our room we were delighted to find that the towels had been replenished and the bed turned down  We enjoyed the view from our room before turning in and having a very restful nights sleep in an incredibly comfortable bed  KUDOS to the Chicago Sheraton for getting everything just right  
hHrA4inXqKPwxaxSRENf We originally made reservations for a weekend getaway but after looking at their website  read about their romantic weekend getaway  Having never been in the area before or stayed at an Ambassador Hotel we really didnt know what to expect  but the pictures online made it look more inviting than it turned out to be  Upon arriving  the parking valet was on break and we ended up having to park our own car  unless we felt like leaving it in the line of traffic  It only went downhill from there  The bed sheets had footprints on them and the bathroom had an odor that we couldnt figure out what it was  We ended up getting a different room  which was very mediocre  Needless to say  we wont be staying here again 
hdVFqrRrvKYHrtWuGYkX I was attending a conference at the Mariott  They were booked up and I shared a room at the Hard Rock for a week by default  What a lucky break  This is a beautiful hotel  I am not a fan of all that blackgrey vibe and find it a little cheesy  What I loved was the way the Hard Rock left the beautiful old hotel features intact  and decorated around the basic stucture  My room was CLEAN  CLEAN  CLEAN  I want to comment on the staff  What an upbeat group of people  This included the doormen  the front desk  the consierge  They were wonderful  Every morning one of the bell men would find my TV morning news show for me in the bar  while I drank their courtesy coffee  They brought us a refrigerator  IPOD dock  and extra suitcase stand within minutes of check in  I had a hard time contacting the airport transport  The consierge took care of it for me  While I was waiting for the 4 50 am airport shuttle  one of the bell men found me a cup of coffee in the back  I just couldnt get over how nice and friendly everyone was    great place to stay  I hope to go back with my husband  
hgzO0N65XbHmyNHogZzY The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago was by far one of the best experiences Ive had  It definitely felt as comfortable as home with the all the luxuriance of a five star establishment  I had forgotten my favorite CD that puts me to sleep each night  When mentioning this in front of the Front desk clerk  she told me that they have a huge collection of CDs available for guests  Low and behold  they had my favorite CD   Also  my laptop was not cooperating  Come to find out  they offer every guest full access to their amazing and fully functional business center  From now on  when visiting Chicago  I will ONLY be staying at the Amalfi Hotel 
hjg022c8VDbZRvzoKbS0 My family and I stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker Dr  on March 27  2012  We were excited about the great price we got for your 4 star hotel through priceline  Unfortunately  we were not impressed  In the past  we have stayed at the Hyatt in downtown San Diego for spring break on the Marina  but chose to stay closer to home this year  The room was not clean to our standards when we arrived  even though we paid for an upgrade  We asked for it to be cleaned while we were sight seeing and were assured it would be looked after  Upon our return  nothing had been moved in the room to re clean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so I can only assume  it wasnt even checked as promised  We only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more  They were promptly delivered but room service took 40  minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice  The curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming  the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it  the honor barfridge was gouged and dirty  too  The mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on   not neat and tidy at all    There were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well  Very disappointing to say the least  I have buyers remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds  We were compensated for our upgrade   20 00 but given the price of parking  taxes  and etc  at this point I wouldnt recommend this Hyatt to anyone  My husband travels and uses his Hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4 star hotel  I felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility 
i9ZIWtrkLfF3cUBcSlDc They rave about their beds but the beds were average  On surface room seemed clean  however  dropped my pen behind nightstand and discovered at least an inch of dust  It appeared there had been repairs to something where they had to cut away part of the wall  The repair job was covered up with a wallpaper board over the hole but the board did not even completely cover hole  Impossible to have a decent shower or bath  EXTREME water saving devices on both the shower and tub provided basically a trickle of water  I was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor  Also be prepared to be nickled and dimed to death  There was even a 10 charge if you used the coffeemaker in the room  really  For room service they tack on a delivery charge and a 20 gratuity  Since the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he earning a gratuity  I have already been charged for him to deliver the food  The parking fees were outrageous at 51 a night but to add insult they charge a hotel patron the same fees as the general public  Upon packing to leave we realized that the dvd set my son had brought was missing  I reported the theft to the hotel  Had to file a report with security who promised me they would investigate and get back to me within 2 days  It has now been over two weeks  No follow up  no apology even given  We will never stay at this hotel again  We have been to Chicago many times and this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at 
iKrsIHAuyeU81iNl7Rcw Home away from home  The suites are amazing with great views of the city  The food is delious and served by an excellent staff  I loved the heated pool on the top floor  very relaxing after a long day of meetings  Great place to stay when your in Chicago 
iTlgfbjJD5eMtlRaSztt I think the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is a upscale place I had my wedding there and it was the best of the best The staff was so helpful and made me feel confident that my wedding would be a success  The chef prepared a lavish sit down dinner with appetizers and desserts They also had a wonderful pastry chef who baked my wedding cake The tables were decorated in very good taste and could not be more perfect The bar was also set up the way I wanted it and even had a champagne fountain  My guests had a wonderful experience with their stay at the hotel and felt pampered The rooms were like suites with a mini bar They had terry cloth bathrobes in each bathroom  If you are looking to have a wedding in the Chicago area look into having it here you will not be disappointed 
idi6r2Ozg66xAeNYeZTF I have been 4 times in Chicago  and I have stayed in 4 different Hotels  This has been for much the very best option  The lobby  the warm of the receptionist  the room  the hotel is very good  It is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile and theres no chance for you to get lost from this hotel  If you like to travel with style this could be a very good option  
ijE9yFEOcjGG55Shsafq I stayed at the intercontinental during the last weekend in September for a pleasure trip    the InterContinental was in a great location and the staff was excellent  The room was clean and comfortable    and came equipped with a new LG flat panel tv  Had breakfast at Zest hotel restaurant    a bit pricey but decent if you want a buffet  The hotel is in walking distance to millenium park  museums and the aquarium  There is also a lot of shopping   window shopping is best though  considering the sales tax is 9 5  and possibly raising to 11 Great stay  I highly recommend it and would stay there again  
j87YS1j9DFQiX1hxuC1G I first walk into the beautifully decorated lobby of the Affinia Chicago hotel where Im greeted by name by the concierge  He tells me that they have taken the liberty of customizing the room to my profile from when I booked the stay  He shows me to my room paying careful attention to my bags  and ensuring that I neednt lift a finger sure enough  the down pillow I had selcted from the dream pillow menu sits proudly atop the queen of the domain  which by the way is covered with the softest of bedspreads making me wonder if they didnt literally drag a cloud in here and fit it on my bed  I notice that theres a display of champagne and cupcakes   atop the dresser and my experience kit which comes complete with an ipod shuffle downloaded with only my favorite workout tracks  and a yoga mat  namaste  Unable to resist the urge to inspect the bathroom  I find that not only is there a marble tiled invisible glass shower  but a jacuzzi  lined with candles of vanilla  deep enough to bathe a walrus  Feeling girlish  I run the water and test before going to dinner  The Hotels restraunt C house offers the most delicious seafood menu that makes you think youre dining with the kings of paradise  or at least eating in the Caribbean itself  hmm  I should have brought a date 
jMiWy6TkSnRuJKc2om18 the James Hotel in Chicago is by far one of the best hotels that My family and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at  The room service is the best in the area  not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for  The lobby and the reception area is very contemporary  This is a great place to take the family to relax  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  5 stars  
jSTnrwek3uM95R9ojfpF Weve stayed here before but this time around was a marked difference in quality and service   the staff wasnt rude  just incompetent  For example  we ordered wine glasses for the room because the hotel no longer services a mini bar in the room  which seemed like a really cheap way to go for this type of hotel  Nonetheless  the staff brought us 4 coffee mugs    The list of issues goes on unfortunately  including the low grade in room movie options   our audio and video did not sync on our rental we eventually had to stop watching after 20 minutes  And the room itself was not clean the bathroom sink vent holes were black with mold  Clearly the hotel has pulled back on not only amenities  but training or sufficient staff    oh  but the price point for this hotel has stayed the same  Find a newer hotel  there are many in this great city 
jgo8cPZLxeMfzcrUnIC0 Named my price on priceline  50 00 Bucks  Hotel room was great  Clean  Clean and new  Fresh crisp sheets  comfortable bed  flat screen TV  clean carpet  nice bath  etc  Short distance to food and sightseeing  I highly recommend this property  Be prepared to pay over 40 00 per night to park  Hey  Its a hyatt  They also charge 5 00 for a bottle of water that is normally a buck  For a total of 100 00 nightly stay in Chicago this place is it just dont drink the bottled water  Happy Travels 
k0T9e0jquvcsG15BKsQA I booked this hotel for my family of 4 to stay overnight to see the Magnificent Mile Christmas Lights Parade  I chose it because it had a sofa sleeper and one bed  We arrived at our hotel around 3 30 PM to check in  We came at this time because the front desk worker said that we could not check in until 3 00 PM  After giving him our name  the manager said OK  we have your king smoking suite available  We quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a non smoking room  He insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room  We went back and forth  then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation  Luckily  we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone  It clearly said non smoking  After showing him our reservation  he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available  So why in the world did he need to see our reservation   We decided to see if we could handle the smoking room  It turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children  The manager eventually called around and found a hampton inn near by with one bed  We canceled our room reservation  We live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home  My family was very disappointed  My husband is a gold member with Hilton  Lets just say we will be switching back to Marriott  The hotel lobby was dated  The smoking room that I saw looked very dated as well  They made an error and never owned up to it  nor did they do anything to compensate us for such a huge inconvenience 
kC2OR3GG9ejhtaBBDcIL This hotel was wonderful  My room was clean and the staff was courteous  The food provided by the restaurant was exceptional  This was on of the best hotel stays  ive experienced  I highly suggest this hotel to others  
kZqc6HiOlLweioMlZf6P After considering several hotels in the area  my family and I finally decided  unfortunately  on Homewood Suites  for our long weekend vacation  Overall  the experience left much to be desired  The breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries  The linens on one of our beds seemed dirty  and when I told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced  the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude  I would not come back here ever 
khofLk3seWf1vIkBK86F The location of this hotel is excellent  The hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say   in my opinion  The room decor is horrible probably more European than I am used to and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment  On the upside  if you want to stay in a great location  feel safe  and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work  I prefer Westin or Marriott   something that you can count on 
krrGSskG78fZsfbs8h74 This hotel is totally overrated  Yes  the location is awesome  but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options  The customer service  or lack thereof  was particularly disappointing  Why are they paying anywhere from 2   8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady Even when her hands are full  The housekeeping staff couldnt figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip  every day  Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you dont bring it anyway  As stated previously  the location is great  Location  however  does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff  I would not stay here again 
l9EhRHf6adGeHYaZzwub The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is not the hotel for persons wishing to have a relaxing getaway  Upon entering this hotel you have the impressions that it is a warm and inviting place  One encounter with the staff will change this point of view immediately  the person who assisted us was not very knowledgeable with his duties and did not provide the overall attention required or expected  Everything about this hotel exudes class and sophistication  Training for the staff should be conducted immediately in order to match classy look of the hotel with their interactions with the customers  I am truly diappointed with the fact that my stay at this hotel was as substandarded as it was  I was so looking forward to a wonderful stay at your establishment  I hope that the issues mentioned earlier are resolved  However  I do not plan to return to this hotel again 
lP6oSffoeXBzOwq0J7DC Great hotel  Went to see the Museum of Contemporary Art which was great  but this hotel almost had it beat  The rooms and even halls are very beautifully done  Great service too  A
lUuHPqklDPROMBujjBQr My stay at the Hilton was like living in luxury for a few days  I never wanted to go back home much less leave the hotel  During my stay I could work out in their facility and swim at no added charge  In fact  they didnt charge for WIFI  morning breakfast or their grocery shopping service  The lobby always had complimentary coffee  tea  soda and meals  I felt like a queen  This hotel deserves highest marks for service  
lmtd659bf8oFEUkp0TCE My visit to the Conrad Chicago in the heart of downtown was a luxurious experience bar none  The lobby is immaculate and is filled with reams of class and style  The rooms are beautifully adorned  I especially like the flat screen TV and wired internet  Im never happy with wireless connections so it is nice to find a hotel that knows that its guests need fast  reliable internet connectivity  and its included at no additional charge  The view from the room was magnificent   downtown Chicago at night  The Restaurant is spectacular but the Terrace is the place to be when weather permits  You cannot get a more breathtaking view and be able to relax in the gentle breeze of evening while dining on the finest gourmet foods  Dont forget to visit the Health and Fitness center with their selection of aerobic and anaerobic workout equipment  The staff is attentive to your every need and the concierges can get you whatever you need  Just ask  This is the place to stay in Chicago if you want to be pampered in luxury 
lrHSNTTBCe78AN9fOzkE Staying at the Sofitel was one of the less pleasurable experiences I have had in Chicago  Upon entering  there was no one offered to take my luggage so I was forced to carry it up to the check in desk  The front desk staff was not friendly or welcoming  The room was smaller than I expected and smelled of fake suede  I decided to have drink and some food in Le Bar and upon entering  I immediately noticed how dimly lit the room was  I could barely see the bartenders face  The drinks were alright and the food was sub par compared to what I was expecting  After an hour  I was ready for bed so I returned to my room to lay down  The mattress was surprising stiff  The noise was higher than expected as well  Thankfully  it was only a one night stay 
lwXS0psBK074Z90MFzTV The rates at The Talbott Hotel were cheaper than I had expected  and that was my reason for booking a room  I had been prepared for service and a room similar to what I had experienced in the past  and I was quite pleased when I did stay  The room was neat and clean  and the halls were quiet at night  The traffic noise was muffled to the point where it was no problem sleeping either  I did ask one question at the service desk and they answered it nicely  which is good because normally hotel workers can be a bit snippy  especially at night  Overall I had no problems with The Talbott Hotel and I would stay at this here again if I were in the area a second time 
m7uYBbOIxquXxgw27ty0 My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad  unfortunately  we would never stay in this hotel again  The rooms looked nice  but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink  The room service cost was super high   costing us over 100 for 1 burger  1 order of french toast  2 pops and 2 desserts  In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake  We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room we were on the 5th floor  same as the reception desk  They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower  The staff was friendly enough  but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems  There was not even a coffee pot in the room  Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price  NOT worth it 
mP27ONuIb3JVokJKb8gY I recently stayed at the Sofitel Hotel Chicago Water Tower  and I was quite disappointed  I was excited by the great location on East Chestnut Street downtown  but this was a mediocre hotel for the price 250 per night before taxes  The view from my room was of the top of a parking garage and some dumpsters  and yes  the view of downtown in the distance was pretty  but I was very disappointed  The bedding seemed to be polyester  not the luxury cotton many lower level hotels are featuring lately  When I ordered room service at 10 30 on a Thursday night  I had to wait for 55 minutes  20 minutes longer than I was quoted  I ordered a salad  and I thought the lettuce was a bit limp as if it had been sitting out for too long  Overall  I was very disappointed by my overpriced stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower 
mQDwRtGqEGHfIGEI5FzS We visited for my 40th birthday  We had never been to Chicago so was not sure where to stay  Found the deal on this hotel from Travelzoo  Great rate  staff was awesome  very helpful and nice  location was great  Enjoyed our stay but still like NYC better  Great  great hotel  Would stay again  
mVoAjaIXZoFDteHzNeVh The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a magnificent grand hotel  The size of the rooms  and the views of the city are phenomenal  At night the city lights up  and the sight is majestic  The hotel itself  and the employees are wonderful  and well worth the pay to stay in such a place  This Hotel has so much to offer  great dining a fantastic gym set up for those of us  who really like to stay fit no matter what we are doing My wife and I have just left recently  and we are already planning to stay there on our next trip out  Big thumbs up to Those who run that place  and helped us enjoy our stay 
mhYtSOPkofXF83vnd5NS Upon entering the Hotel Monaco CHicago  i could see the beauty of a classically elegant building  The old fashioned furnishings  the wonderful view  and the polished wood decorating the entore hotel  At first i had been skeptical  but any doubts i had carried into the hotel were gone  As i entered my room  the fresh flowers and the amazing Chicago view greeted me  During my stay i enjoyed my free time lounging by the pool  winding down every night with a comforting massage  I would recommend this hotel not only for the pure elegance  but for the wonderful customer service and the fantastic amenities  
n1wrqyQhCZJ6zvaKiiYF We stayed at Omni Chicago for 2 nights in early July July 1 3  The reason we chose this hotel was simply because of a great deal we got on TravelZoo  We got pretty good rate that included a valet parking and vouchers for foodbeverages  I also signed up for their loyalty program  which was so worth it  I was concerned at first that we would be treated like a second class guest because of the price we paid  But I was totally wrong  They treated us extremely well  Before our arrival  I got an email asking if we needed anything  So  I asked for a fridge to store the baby milk  And they arranged it for us without charge   We arrived late on Thursday night  Our room was ready for us upon our arrival with the fridge I requested  We were given a corner suite on the 10th floor   very nice room   comfy bed  My husband was really wowwwww    The bed was made ready for us   both in the bedroom and the sofa bed we didnt use the sofa bed though  We got a high speed Internet as part of the loyalty program  All staff were friendly and helpful   front desk  valet parking  bell boy  room service  concierge     everyone  We used the voucher for room service breakfasts both morning  The first day was great  Food was great  and quick  We also got complimentary beverages as part of the loyalty program  We ordered OJ and hot chocolate  They both were so good that we ordered them again the next morning  But we were very disappointed that the hot chocolate tasted pretty horrible  It tasted like left over coffee mixed with water and a bit of chocolate   Also  we ordered Belgian waffle for our breakfast  which was supposed to come with whipped cream and strawberries   but we got a plain waffle  So  we had to call the restaurant and wait for a while to get those  This is why I didnt give 5 for service  However  I reported these issues to the front desk when checking out  and the front desk staff took care of it by not charging us for that meal  Another thing is that its quite noisy at night even though we were on the high floor  We could hear siren going on  off during the night  But this is out of the hotels control though  And I would say that it didnt bother us at all  My baby could sleep very well  Overall  we really enjoyed our stay  and would definitely consider Omni for our next trip to Chicago  
n7XzWOyleRcsqmbeHAqx our stay was absolutely perfect  its a cool hotel to look at  the design and feel is very trendy and hip  all the staff are terrific  especially the consierge staff great info and attitude  our room was on the top floor  with great views  super comfy bed  and neat bathroom  fantastic  choose this with no hesitation  
nHheUt9RvcSIAiOeUCFS My wife and I went to Chicago to enjoy our weekend and stayed at Hyatt Regency  Hyatt Regency Chicago has ruined our family holiday weekend  First of all  if you are not a diamond or platinum member  you need to reserve the room atleast 10 15 days in advance  You have to pay extra 20 for the welcome credit option  They will give you a credit of 75 for the 2 days  We only used 20 and the rest was forefeited  I talked to the manager and he said we cant use it on our next visit  The management of the hotel is full of cheap minded people  When you know most of the hotels let you use their wi fi for free  Hyatt Regency management asked us to pay for using their wi fi  Beware of this place  if you want to enjoy your weekend in Chicago  Hyatt Regency should be the last place you should consider staying  Thanks Sam 
nLsrCZC3dczdCaFLQrcU We just got back from a great weekend in Chicago and have no complaints about the Palmer House  Its very easy to get to from Oharethe Blue line on the EL train and then just a 2 block walk from the train station  The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff is super friendly and go out of their way to help  We booked an airhotel package deal on Expedia  We expected to stay in a room with a full size bed but for only 45 extra per night we upgraded to the Excutive level  Best decision of the trip  We had a beautiful room with a King bed down comforter robes plush towels etc   it also included a nice Continental breakfast each morning all day snacks and beverages and a great happy hour  We took advantage of this every day  The location was great  lots of shopping along State St  and to get to the Magnificent Mile was a 5 cab ride or a 20 minute walk  Well be back to Chicago and the Palmer House  
nl71rNmtlZYgSA5NLTOP Reviews a little late  but    My husband  I first stayed at the Amalfi in 806 totally based on reviews I read on this website  We were totally WOWED   Loved the location  the room  the Aveda bath products  but most of all loved the evening reception  breakfast on our floor  I returned to Chicago with 3 girlfriends in 907 and booked us in a suite at the Amalfi  It was great   room was very spacious and my girlfriends were quite pleased  Will stay next time Im in Chicago too   P S  They honor a government rate     
nuRklwfL1msTQRLegxmJ After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed  I booked through their web site about 2 12 months prior to arrival for 170night plus tax for a room with 2 queens  The location was perfect   right by the river near Michigan Ave    minutes walk to the El  Millenium Park  the Theater District and Shopping  The room was clean  a little larger than standard and nicely decorated  We had window seats in the room with a view of the river  There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening  To top it off  the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area  
nxwAreCxSp4afmvEVswO The Talbot hotel is an elegant place to take you wife or husband for a weekend getaway  The personally yours romantic package was fabulous  Upon check in we opened our room door and found a romantic atmosphere  There was rose pedals and luxurious bathrobes  We felt like it was our honey moon all over again  
oFn2coNphJAYXJ5GCFtl This is a superb hotel  The rooms are huge  including a luxurious bathroom  It is clean and service is first rate  Breakfast was excellent and complimentary for Hilton Honors members  Hotel is in a good location  and is connected to a mall  which I imagine would be a great asset in the Chicago winter  Next time I go to Chicago  I will stay here for sure  
oVF0DDlOOqH3wsheyk7Z My husband and I recently chose the Palmer House Hilton for a rare couples getaway from our usual life  and an escape it truly provided  There is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time  let alone with ever elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user  A bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us  because things like alarm clocks  hairdryers and ironing boards were already there  electronic media even available for rent  With a comfortable bed  control over how the room felt  no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call  we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the Chicago culture in close proximity  Too often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning  but the Hilton was a true vacation  Thank you 
osAYiqoH58wC35iGLxZJ This is an absolutely exquisite hotel  at a great location  and boasting superb amenities  I was here on a personal trip and really enjoyed being so close to the shopping on Michigan Ave  The hotel itself has a pleasant ambiance and the staff made me feel welcome and quickly responded to my requests for various items from the front desk  I appreciated the homey  well designed interior and views of the city  It was also nice to have good food at my disposal late night so I didnt have to wander the city for my late night meal  This will definitely be my hotel of choice when I return to the city  
p5olyMB8eqU5jRKn61e4 I had purchased this deal of off groupon  Lets just say we found a bunch of hidden treasures  when We layed down to sleep in our bed  We lifted our blanket and found very distubing spotting on our bed attached in photos  we immediatly called the front desk  The only thing they offered was a new set of sheets  when the room service men came to change the sheets he brought us another one with a big red stain on it and quicklyhid changed it before we seen it and he apologized and offered to bring us new ones once again  we denied since it was so late and just slept on the sheets the appeared to be clean  Then next day i eagerly showed the fronk desk and manager the photos  and they offered me a 68 refund  I was very dissapointed and dirty sheets that made us very uncomfortable and sleepless and I broke out on my face with ACNE i never had a acne or skin issues im positive something in those dirtyy sheets  We drove 4 5 hours to enjoy Chicago and we stayed  the hard rock based on reputatuion  and unfortunitly we were very disspointed  it was DISGUSTING  I then wrote a Email to management and HEARD NOTHING BACK  NOT even a response or apology  I just really expected alot more 
pFYMwMQrhgjVA3qnu3DD Spent three nights at the hotel for a girls weekend  The staff was wonderful  room was beautiful and location great  You can take the train directly from Midway and walk one block to the hotel  Very close to museums and restaurants  I have stayed here before and it always proves to be a great choice for a trip to Chicago  
pN3AilBmAh2rhqBuFGca We booked at another hotel a block away and spent a unhappy night  We walked over to the Talbott and the courtiest staff showed us a room and we booked the rest of our stay  The room was very attractive and well furnished with double sinks in the bathroom  The tub is large and the shower a pleasure  The location was quiet as requested  The staff was always cheerful and very helpful  Tim and Stephanie provide excellent concierge services  The breakfast at the Basil Cafe is a great way to start the day  We travel a lot and appreciate the ambiance of a good hotel  I would highly recommend the Talbott for your stay  
pXjuXjXYasAMvD4tOQBU First  several day s prior to my stay  I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room service Saturday and Sunday  Saturday they didnt bring breakfast   and when I called room service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge  When they finally did bring it   they brought the wrong thing   and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday  I was further inconvenienced by in room dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night  The food was limp and uninspired  Further  I ordered soup   which arrived without a spoon  When I called in room dining to request a spoon  I was told one would be forthcoming  15 minutes later  a waiter arrived with a menu  When I explained I already had food and I didnt need a menu   I needed a spoon  he had the audacity to argue with me  I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so  Another 15 minutes and one bowl of cold soup later I decided to call in room dining back to request again they send someone with a spoon  They too argued with me and expressed that theyd already sent someone with a spoon  I explained that they had not   that I had received a menu I didnt request  but that no spoon was forthcoming  Another 15 minutes later  a spoon finally arrived  Thanks   for charging me 100 so that I could argue over cold  flavorless food  In addition to the gross customer service  surly attitude  and sorry food  I found the room woefully lacking  It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell  Further  I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators    I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went 
pcL7NCX7mr6KvXdILr7L We absolutely loved the Knickerbocker  Now  if you expect your hotels to be cookie cutter comfortable  forget this place  If Holiday Inns are like the rows of housing developments in the suburbs  the Knickerbocker is like those beautiful old houses in the center of the city  The location is great  the hotel bar is cozy and classy  and the rooms feel like guest bedrooms in Victorian mansions  For the price  you simply cant do any better than this in downtown Chicago  
pmWeoqM7F4S8A6EkZnbX I was very unsatisfied with my stay at the Allegro  The front desk clerk seemed very put out when we walked up to her window  After giving her our confirmation number she let us know that our rooms were not ready yet  This came as a surprise to me since we arrived late in the day and check in had already began  After waiting an hour to check in we were not able to get the room features that we had requested  We were informed that they were only requests and not a guarantee  Room service was also very slow and appeared to be understaffed  When we finally got someone to answer the phone they were out of most everything we wanted  The food took an eternity to reach the room and the order wasnt exactly right either  This is not the kind of service I expected from an upscale hotel 
pqdd7pIHEn5jx33iZOT6 We planned a fun time for our kids this summer by booking a kids suite at the Swissotel Chicago  Our fun time was not exactly that  Upon arriving for our weekend getaway  we find that the reservations we made online and the confirmation we held in our hand for a kids suite  did not mean a thing  Apparently  there were none of the kids suites available  The kids suite is supposed to have things to keep the kids happy when they are in the room  coloring  video games  etc  No one at the front desk could explain to us why there were no kids suites available  Whatever  So  we took a regular suite with the promise that we would be moved as soon as one became available  Guess what We spent the whole weekend in the same room  Yes  the staff apologized  but no one seemed overly concerned that our children were dissapointed and no compensation or extras were offered to make us less cranky about it  Other than that and the fact the none of the hotel staff was very friendly  the rooms were clean  We did not spend a lot of time in the hotel  but I will not be booking a room here again  The staff did not impress me at all and we did not feel like we were treated well at all 
qE9cXyCbfs2VS6ESrgyA I was very happy with my stay at the Knickerbocker  The room were nice  and the staff was excellent  I was able to stay here for 80 per night thru Priceline  That was an incredible bargain in my opinion    this hotel is very nice  It has an excellent location     just off of Michigan Ave  All of the best shopping in Chicago can be found right around the corner  Its a great location     very close to many great attractions  If there is any negative it would be that there is no swimming pool  but I think that is common with a lot of the older hotels in Chicago  I would definately recommend this place     hopefully I will be able to stay there again in the future  
qLo6qoRy6reOVEBEfOfX The InterContinental Chicago Hotel is one of the finest hotels I have stayed at in a long time  The atmosphere upon arrival was one of elegance and beauty  The staff welcomed us and catered to our every need  The rooms were plush and very romantic  Interior decor was breathtaking  It is definitely above a 4 star rating and I would not think twice about coming back here  It received my highest recommendation 
qPcH4gpXJGiGhsU6x2Tl The Conrad Hilton recently took over this property from the failed Meridian Hotel  It seems that the Conrad has inherited a hotel property that just doesnt work  The entrance is very difficult to find  There are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby  As a result  there was often a line waiting for them  The same problem affects the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area  If you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay  you will find the poor elevator layout annoying  The King room is what I would consider small compared to other Chicago hotels  Although I like modern design  the room was quite stark and cold  It was also showing quite a bit of wear and tear  The bathroom was the best part  Has anyone from management tried to sit in the chair and work at the desk It was the most uncomfortable set up Ive experienced  The views are non existent for most of the rooms  In a city with amazing vistas  this was disappointing  I saw a couple walking the halls with management trying to find a room that was acceptable to them  Room service breakfast was a highlight of our stay  Excellent food and high quality presentation  Sorry I couldnt write a better review  Would I stay here again No  Chicago has some incredible hotels and this is not one of them 
qlqjN8PvPbnJzHl8N7Te We stayed here for a weekend trip to Chicago and we will come back and stay here again  It was great place front desk clerks were very helpful Also we loved the view  Very nice quiet place and upto date and super clean  We will def stay here again highly recommended 
r58p3ICrNvM5Q8oTGF0z i recently stayed at the amalfi hotel in Chicago and was very disappointed right from the beginning  the girl at the front desk was busy talking to a one of her friends and when i finally did get her to wait on me she was rude and seemed bothered to have to wait on me  the room wasnt at all what i was expecting  it was dingy  dirty  and just seems like an old hotel  just not what i was looking for in a nice hotel  seemed like the quality youd expect from a cheap motel 
rIMQV4gGHH7m1ZUuGAXI A decent place to stay  The people are nice enough  yet the atmosphere was not what I was expecting  The rooms were not very spacious  nor welcoming  So many places to eat  yet the food was very pricey and average  I would stay here again possibly  but I feel like I could find a better option for a better price 
rWUriO3ffNI075D38byU Staff were friendly  room was well kept like a typical Hyatt location  Hotel is huge  with two buildings and over 2000 rooms  Good location  close to Michigan Ave and the subway  Parking is 48day  Ouch  I bid on it on Priceline for 59  
rfJNTadLbshovaxj7zCg We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend  We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10 00 a m   and they were able to give us our rooms early  Hooray  We were on the 5th floor Beatles theme  The rooms were very comfortable  One of our rooms was on a corner  and had lots of windows  The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows  Not a great view from our side of the hotel  but we didnt pay for a room with a view  The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable  the bathroom was full of Aveda products  and there was a bathrobe in the closet  The tvdvdstereo combo was nice  but we werent in the room a lot to use it  We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacksdrinks as they were weighted and wed be charged  No problems there  We did not make use of the free fitness center  because the weather was perfect  My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead  He said it was wonderful  We did use the free internet in our rooms  It was wired internet  but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway  The room was a bit dim at night  but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps  There was virtually no hall  elevator noise  The location of the Hard Rock is ideal  It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery  just blocks to either Grant Park  The Art Institute  State Street Shopping  or Michigan Ave  To sum up  there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about  We would be glad to stay here again any time  
rwiFxdYYUBzgDndCVLYM Stayed here for 3 nights for a BridgestoneFirestone convention  No complaints  Room was great with a beautiful view  Staff was very accommodating  Had drinks and appetizers in main bar  Fantastic  Great location  Yes its a huge hotel as its used for conventions but that didnt stop it from being a great place  
s7nuyzHj4UnszJ2bbkaE Not worth the price  We almost stayed at a hotel for 110 a night  but instead choose the Hard Rock for 180 a special  We were located on the newly renovated Beatles floor  The carpets in the hallways looked like they needed to be replaced  Upon entering our room we found some cool Beatles artwork along with a 3x4 foot Marilyn Manson portrait  I think they were halfway done re theming the room  At checkout they tried to charge us 11 for using the mini bar which we didnt even open  They removed the charge right away but I wonder if they try to get unsuspecting people with that charge  Nothing special here  If you want to pay a bunch extra for some light theming then this is the place for you 
sF9mtfz0rCsBN3qF67Xd The Downtown Chicago Hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel  perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions  Staying with a Hilton means the essentials are never a concern  as always  the room was clean and impeccably neat  the staff friendly and very capable  The wireless access and big flat screen TV were an added plus too  Best of all  it is a pet friendly hotel  something that is unusual in bigger city 4 diamond hotels  Thanks  Chicago Hilton  for a great stay 
sfItZ0NCX89qmHObAXlm Three nights there on business  Hadnt realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement  very bleak  Told the front desk that I hadnt realized about the construction  so Id have to switch hotels  they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights  So I stayed  TV didnt work  Tried to get them to fix it and they ignored me   eventually after I called again  a few hours later  a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it  Long and complicated experience at the business center which doesnt open until 9am  BTW  where I ended up paying 45 to print 55 pages  Had to buy these cards  and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway  and charging me for them  I was left with 22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago  2000 miles from where I live  I asked for a refund on the card and    no surprise    she declined to help me with that  Nice room  nice view  but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad  Worst experience Ive ever had at a hotel when traveling for business 
sml5rzTNmwNZARZ4DFgr I just left the Conrad Chicago and have nothing but good things to say  We used Hilton points to stay there but paid 35night to upgrade to a junior suite  We were in room 1519  I would reccomend people ask for an odd numbered room so that they will have a view looking north on Michigan Ave  Our room was very modern with 2 large HDflat panel tv and Bose 3 speaker sound system  4 big windows that actually open  The bed lineds were very nice  the towels were OK  The room was clean and the bath room had a seperate shower and tub  Marble everywhere  Robes  slippers  etc  The work out room was good with different machines and some free weights  There are clean towels in the workout room too  We never ate in the hotel so I cant comment on the food or the prices  There is a Starbucks across the street Michigan and an Espresso bar attached to the Nordstrom that is on the ground floor of the hotel  It was very nice to have the little mall right under the hotel  The location of the hotel could not be better  We were walking distance to everything  Every kind of shopping or dinning experience you could possibly want was within 2 miles  Over all the hotel had a boutique feel to it even though it is part of the hilton chain  
t2TQz7w6txbRKrv1LmIG We just returned from 4 nights at the Ambassador East  What a gem  The location in the Gold Coast neighborhood is perfect for finding restaurants and walking the Magnificent Mile  There is a train station about 2 blocks away  The room was very comfortable  with nice amenities  and there is free Internet service on the 2nd floor  Best of all was the bell and lobby staff  They really went out of their way to be helpful and greeted us warmly each time we left and arrived  I would say that this was the nicest hotel staff Ive encountered in all my travels  
tBu3Yx1TiphYh9sMsfqy My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience  The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location  Its in a quiet location  yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to  We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost  It didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have  but it was elegantly appointed  spacious  and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet  The service was amazing  Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful  as well as knowledgeable  This was true from the doormen at the front  to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant  Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions  and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out  The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel  this goes for the room service as well  Dinner there was good  but not great  I mentioned almost flawless  as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel  It involved scheduling and was aggravating  as the hotel actively encourages its use  However  Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied  following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with  The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly  Overall  we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits  
tdxCfne590JsvlU0ju8b The atmosphere at the Talbott Hotel is very welcoming when you first walk in  The employees are friendly and will greet you when you first arrive  The hotel seems to be luxurious  even from the lobby  and right away  I was very excited for my stay  I stayed in a double queen room with my friend  The room is spacious enough  and beds are very comfortable  I didnt try the room service  but they do have a fitness club close by with a spa  which is very convenient  I also love how the room has individual climate controls  Very neat  Also handy that there is an iHome in the room  Im usually stuck using just a regular alarm clock radio at other hotels  I will most likely stay in this hotel another time  It was a wonderful experience 
tv1oSBQmPYvIS3bNuSIl I accompanied my husband on a business trip to Chicago back in September and we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel  The place was absolutely oozing with old fashioned charm  Also  there were plenty of shopping opportunities within walking distance  so I shopped while my husband worked  It just doesnt get any better than that  I loved the service we received and the ambiance of that grand old hotel  and Id definitely stay there again 
uFwtevzBRgOOFkDVmOul How should I start Well  after staying at the Ambassador East Hotel  i realized it was my favorite hotel ever  The rooms are amazing  The food is great  The Pump room bar is awesome  I love this hotel  If your ever in Chicago  the Ambassador East Hotel is the place to go 
uOBZrm9y5FkQ3LTkXtwf I booked my weekend Chicago stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago because of the location as well as some good reviews I found online  However  my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel fell short of my expectations  When I arrived  well over an hour of check in time  I was told that my room was not yet ready and I was left awkwardly waiting around for another half an hour as I did not want to leave the hotel again before settling in  The hotel staff I interacted with seemed generally uninterested in their jobs  and while I do appreciate that this is a hip hotel popular with a younger crowd  there was an excessive amount of noise on the floor I was staying on throughout the night until about half past four in the morning when it quieted down after two calls to the front desk to make complaints about this issue  As I am a fairly light sleeper  I woke up several times throughout the night  I would recommend bringing earplugs if youre also a light sleeper but would like to get in some decent sleep  Overall the hotel looked very nice  but I just felt that my experience was not worth the amount I paid for my room 
uVRvpv9TVIdR2jH7ryGX Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown is a wonderful hotel  The hotel is very elegant  classy and only offers the best  The hotel offers complimentary breakfast  along with delicious meals and wines in the afternoons  The suites are very real designed and has a very upscale look  This wonderfully cozy yet graceful hotel leaves you with an experience of a lifeltime  I would recommend this awesome hotel to anyone that was looking for beautiful  yet comfortable hotel experience 
uk38lFia7vMrbUHbx8Yr The hotel is staffed by very nice but many inexperienced people  Executive lounge has limited hours and no access outside of those hours  Other areas similarly lack the level of service that is expected for this type of hotel  One of the individuals at the concierge desk twice gave us bad information about public transportation and the hours at one place  While the location is good  this particular hotel is simply not a good representation of what Swissotel is supposed to be  and there are far better choices in Chicago  It would not be my choice for a return stay 
uuCavAOgXHH2gENqY7ir When I first looked at the Hotel Monaco Chicago   a Kimpton Hotels website  the hotel looked very pleasing and a great place for me to stay during my visit to Chicago  The problems began when I called to make a reservation  The woman who answered was very rude  to say the least  I had a few questions about the spa services  She rushed through what sounded like she was reading through a brochure  I decided that I shouldnt let one person ruin my experience with the hotel so I made a reservation and soon I was in Chicago  The front desk service was very pleasant when I arrived  and the room seemed clean  other than the mysterious stain on my bedsheets  I got dressed up and went down to the bar area for a drink and appetizers  It took over thirty minutes for any worker to approach me for an order  Yet two other parties that walked in after me were served right away  I was baffled considering I was dressed nice and in a fairly good mood considering it was my first trip to Chicago  Needless to say I will not be staying at this hotel again 
vCI0pRW6bWujO6D6FlXT I was going on a 3 day personal trip to Chicago  and I decided to indulge myself a bit this time around  I chose to stay at the Talbot  an upscale hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago  To start off  I was NOT pleased  For the hundreds I pay a day  I expected an impeccable hotel  First  the check in process was bad as somehow it took them nearly 15 minutes to find a reservation I had placed nearly A MONTH in advance  Some customer service they claim  Next  when I went to my room  I found that room service had not cleaned it at all  I was forced to wait as they called up a maid to entirely reclean the room as it was strewn with used towels and such  In summary  yes  it was a fancy hotel  yes it had nice accommodations  but the service I experienced there was simply not up to par with a hotel of that price 
vPGz1XeYdBBOkHkVRbwy Very disappointed in our stay in Chicago Monoco  We have stayed many times elsewhere  primarily in washington DC and are accustomed to great customer service  beverages like water or soda at the wine bar  coffee and papers in the morning  help with bags  Not only did the Chicago monoco do none of these things  the staff was not helpful  either  Requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there  YOu got the feeling you were bothering people if you asked a question  No bellman  the doorman did not open the door or help with bags  Even though we were traveling with a child  I had to request a fish when they did not bring it  Really baffling   as we love the Monoco in Washington 
vTZRUQjaAjncEqLmpfXr Guys trip to Chicago  scored this hotel on Priceline for 100 a night  Had a little confusion over the bed situation at first  They said they only had kings available even after I had called and requested 2 doubles  After a 30 minute ordeal at the front desk they put us in a room with 2 doubles  The room was nice  nothing specacular  a little on the small side but nice  The lobby was beautiful to look at but thats about it  Hotel is within walking distance to Soldier Field  Sears Tower  ESPN Zone  and lots of bars and restaurants  Great location that and the price we got the room for made our trip  Would definately try and stay at this hotel again  
vlWqXb4LBa5QgdIgNQjO I was REALLY looking forward to a nice relaxing stay at the end of a long vacation  but unfortunately that was not to be had  From the moment we arrived at the Omni  the staff was belligerent and extremely rude  They had lost our reservation and refused to give us the rate we had booked before  If we werent so tired  we wouldve gone to a different hotel right then  but hindsight is 2020  After we FINALLY got checked in after being made to wait needlessly for 45 minutes in the lobby  we decided to go down to the pool  which was tiny and kind of dirty  so we had walked all the way down there in our suits for nothing  The internet access was really slow  I will NEVER stay here again  Save yourself the headache and book somewhere else 
w5zfZAM1bQQRSOoVnF9S We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights for a friends reunion  The room was clean and new feeling  nice city view  free bottled water in room upon arrival  Check in was a breeze  and our room was ready even though we were several hours early  All staff was friendly and helpful  excellent breakfast  
wIXCdbZ7vRyMyJpkyCer I was very disappointed with this hotel  The front desk clerk was rude she was on a personal call and took 10 mins  to get off the phone  When I arrived in the room the bed wasnt made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty  I called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignmenton the twelveth floor  Once downstairs the clerk treated me as though I had done something wrong  When I arrived in the new room I found the bathroom less than clean    There was hair all over the floor  toilet and shower  The shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror  My allergies started to bother me  immediately upon entering the room  so I checked the filter in the air conditioner  Which looked like it had never been cleaned The comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum  While waiting on acceptable room I went to dinner  Which proved to be as bad as the rooms  The lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy  The steak was rare and I asked for medium  Not to mention  it tasted like rotten meat The veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry  To top the whole experience off    When I went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a 2 day hospital stay 
waN4fJ123Hr7fPUWW5c7 I read the reviews on Trip Advisor for this property which had it ranked as 1 in Chicago  I got a king room overlooking Michigan Ave  The view was beautiful  The room was also impeccable  Nice and bright  very fresh and modern  I find it very hard to fault any Sofitels  The service  attentiveness of staff  cleanliness and luxury are always top notch  Location was great  head left from the lobby and you reach a bunch of european style cafes and restaurants  Straight ahead of the hotel on Michigan Ave is a shoppers paradise  A great place to stay  and much better value than Park Hyatt  I do find some of the charges in luxury hotels to be a bit crazy  such as for the internet  When you are paying top dollar  a few inclusions would be nice  
wkKzxICoIga0mcFVBDJK The Homewood Suites by Hilton  in downtown Chicago  has to be one of the most comfortable and affordable hotels in the windy city  After asking the doorman  I discovered all guest suites in the entire establishment feature a two room layout with a fully equipped kitchen  The full sized refrigerator caused me to do a double take  as did the stove and LCD televisions  This is definitely the place to have a home away from home while in Chicago  Its mind blowing that a hotel this extravagant can have rates as low as 40 a night  which is what I payed when I stayed there in September  The atmosphere was warm and cozy  and the staff were all very friendly and professional 
x1W9wJzHjv2oggtJ78Fh We chose to stay at the Hilton Chicago because it was in such a centralized location  everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close  What I didnt expect was for the beds to be so comfortable  I cant remember when I got a better nights sleep  The staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept  Well be returning to the Hilton Chicago the next time were in town 
xBOPygy1ZC1bn5REnkHn The Ambassador East was a average hotel at best  and mediocre at worst  The bright spot is a very helpful and friendly staff  The doormen and the concierge were especially helpful and willing to do what they could for you  The room was lackluster  however  The bathroom was in especially bad shape  It was dirty when we arrived  with hair in the sink and shower  The shower was in really bad shape  The shower head adjustment did not work properly and water pressure was very low  The water temperature did not get warm during the first morning of our visit  The decor throughout the hotel lobby  hallways and rooms was very out of date and old fashioned  I would have liked there to have been a vending machine in the hotel as well  The business center with free Internet access was a nice feature that was easy to use  The hotels location was okay though it was a bit of a hike to the most popular tourist destinations  I would not stay at this hotel again based on its current conditions  but if it underwent some renovations to update the rooms and the bathrooms  I might be inclined to stay there again     read more
xNGbV0moehyoxzQ2Uo0u Everything you would would expect from a top notch hotel and exceeded by the service  The trendy decor and easy to access dining gave us a second wind pick up after a day of sight seeing  This hotel is definitely the place that I want to come back to  By the time we left after 4 days and 3 nights  my wife and I wished we had more time to enjoy the restaurant a few more times and the delightful Swiss flare  One of the things we enjoyed the most was seeing the water from our window  The feeling of being pampered can only come from the very gracious hotel staff and this hotel is number 1 in my mind  
xTEW9SpxufwdWo2jtDu2 We usually stay at the Sofitel but thought we would try the Conrad for a change  I dont think I would rate this hotel over the Sofitel but it was still 1st class  But I do think the service was better at the Conrad  We arrived at the hotel just before the restaurant closed and soon we were the only table left  Normally service goes down hill then but our waiter Eric was the best  Even when I kept ordering my after dinner ports  The meal may not have been The Chop House but it was still very good  The bar was ok  no Crown Reserve  They did have the Cask 16 at 24 a drink  ouch  The room service was very quick  Our room was very clean and the maids replace everything including the ashtrays during their visits  The only fault we could find was the temperature on the 14th floor  It was so hot that we had our window open the whole time with the heat turned completely off  Which wasnt so bad since my wife smokes  The temp on the 5th where the lobby  bar  and restaurant was fine  We enjoyed the hotel enough that we will be back in Sept  One last thing  if you like a cheap fantastic breakfast  Go to the West Egg  only a few blocks away  
xnFLzKdY0wq8d3p3k2gN We chose the Talbott Hotel primarily for the location  but quickly discovered that the location was the only good thing about it  Although their website did a good job of selling their services and amenities  we found both severely lacking  We had mentioned to the reservationist when booking that this was to be a romantic weekend getaway for us   it was our anniversary  We asked for  and were promised  a king room  However  when we checked in  we were told by the front desk clerk that no king rooms were available  We could either take a double queen room  or pay significantly more for a suite  We took the key for our double queen room and were on our way  Upon arriving on our floor  we found a rowdy group of young girls running up and down the hallway  squealing and playing  It turns out that this hotel offers American Girl visits for the nearby store  It turns out that our romantic getaway room was in the center of a block of rooms reserved for a Girl Scout troop on an American Girl trip  We went back downstairs to request a move to another room  and were told no other double queen rooms were currently available  We explained that we were here for our anniversary  and the ambiance wasnt exactly what we were looking for  The clerk rolled her eyes and told us that she couldnt help us   they didnt have anything else  Sorry  Back upstairs we went  Tired from travel  we decided to order from room service for dinner  Our pasta  when it arrived  was barely warm and mediocre in flavor  We ate it anyway and prepared for bed  After using the bathroom  we discovered that the toilet in our room continued to cycle water after flushing  After jiggling the handle a few times and poking around in the tank  we couldnt get the water to stop running  It took three hours for a maintenance staff member to make their way up to our room to fix the problem  The next morning  after showering  I discovered the hair dryer didnt work properly  After pulling my wet hair back in a clip  we went out for the day  Upon our return  we expected to find our room made up and fresh  It hadnt been touched  We called downstairs to have someone sent up to clean it  but by the time wed left for dinner  nobody had arrived  Our room wasnt made up that day  That night  the Girl Scouts sat in the hallway giggling and singing until well after 1am  We asked them several times to be quiet  but they didnt want to listen  and their chaperones were nowhere to be seen  We called down to the desk  and they told us they would take care of it  but the girls continued to have their party in the hallway anyway  Nobody came to shoo them away  The next morning  I turned on the hairdryer  expecting it to work after reporting the difficulty the day before  It didnt  Stuck wearing my clip again  we checked out and made a mental note to select another hotel in the area for our next trip  This hotel had potential  but the staff doesnt care enough about your experience to allow me to recommend it to other travelers 
xtfLRrxR36uodruRgeoL Stayed at the Fitzpatrick before  about 4 years ago  it was ok  The management was great  staff was so kind  and rooms were clean   But this time I promised my self NEVER to go back   The new staff was so rude   I made a reservation for my Anniversary on the internet  and the day of check in I was told by the hotel staff that they do not have my reservation  1 I was transferred around back and forth from the hotel staff to the reservations hotline  2 Staff was extremely rude  Not arrogant  but rude  Like they hated thier job  3 They offered check in at 1pm but the room wasnt ready till 3pm  4 There were stains everywhere  5 Because of the high sales of rooms due to popularity on this site  they must have hired a cheap unfriendly staff 
xzsozvTV7FiYaVYQfwIl We went with the great reviews on Tripadvisor  The location  rooms  amenities and price via Expedia were good  My complaint is the poor service at every stage   the check in was slow even at 1am  the concierge Sarita was hopeless  staff were generally rude  Also there was some sort of generator box under the bed which hummed all night   we turned it off and it also seemed to turn off the air conditioning  Finally  just to let you know that there is a major construction site in front of the hotel and roadworks at 2am with trucks that beep continuously everytime they reverse    Would I stay here again   maybe if I got a good deal and had a back room but there are plenty of other great hotels nearby 
y6BCxTKzWmm6LIeHlFc5 Swissotel continues to be a yawn As previous posters state  punching in your floor is ridiculous  On the other hand  technology wise it could be helpful in routing ppl to different elevators but if idiots like to cram into one elevator and leave the others free for me  why change In any case  I want to take a nice hot soak and  guess what  they are having water problems    SOOOOO disappointed  Hopefully I dont get bug bitten this time checked under the sheets  Sadly  due to my companys deal  I think I have to stay here again next year sigh   but so far they are batting 1 star                    Oh boy  it must be my luck   or rather this hotel is just run down  I had to swap room FOUR TIMES  And thats for a Thurs nite Sunday morning stay  My first room had no hot water so I had to switch rooms  They gave me the key to the 2nd room  which happened to be occupied  Luckily the occupants had their security latch on  so there wasnt any embarrassing moment  My third room was fine for 2 nights but then today just now I had to move because of water leakage above my room and below my room  BOY  talk about an awful hotel or my just awful luck Maybe its karma since I wrote a bad review last year  and continue to write one   but its the TRUTH  Oh  also last year may not have been bed bugs  I have checked the room and it looks bug free but I STILL get these itchy patches on my leg  Perhaps it is something in the sheets   or the airHVAC     in any case  despite the decent staff  it is a ONE at best 0 for hotel  1 for the still nice service  since its not their fault     All I can say is    THANK GOODNESS MY COMPANY WONT HOLD THE CONFERENCE IN CHICAGO NEXT YEAR  or AT LEAST AT THIS HOTEL        
yK5thMygeQqIPCWX2Pl1  We enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago  It was elegant  classy  and the service was impeccable  It was very family friendly for us  with the spacious rooms  the kids room  and the no smoking policy  We were just a short walk away from shopping and entertainment and the whole family enjoyed the virtual city tour that helped us decide what we wanted to see  The food was delicious and we didnt have to go outside the hotel to find good food  When visiting Chicago again  we will come back  It was a luxurious experience at a reasonable price  Linda Davies 
yPHsGAPJya4AswH5W2W7 We recently completed our first visit to Chicago and were pleasantly surprised by the Affinia Chicago hotel where we stayed  The hotel has gone to great lengths to offer extra services to their guests  including individual pillow choices  complimentary kits with items designed to enhance the city visit and fine dining in two on site restaurants  one of them roof top with amazing city views  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago 
yWevDbZ78NozmTpoGv9O The Hotel Sofitel Chicago Water Tower bills itself as a 4 star luxury hotel  but the luxury is evidently in the eye of the beholder  Filled with trite modern art and modular  cheap looking furniture that looks straight out of the latest Ikea catalogue  this 32 floor hunk of glass has to be one of the ugliest hotels I have ever seen  Urban chic design does not equal comfort the seating and bed furniture are made more for the design floor than for actual use  Room service is expensive  slow  and the food you eventually do get is mediocre in quality and flavor  The hotel features two bars  the Cafe des Architectes Bar  and the simply named Le Bar  Cutesy French names and trendy modern outfittings do not a good hotel bar make  Excellent service  fair prices  friendly and competent staff are what make a bar great  none of which you will find at either of these bars  Cafe des Architectes is also a restaurant  offering seasonal menus featuring contemporary cuisine with French roots  which means small portions and large prices at questionable quality  Even the old standby filet mignon did not stand up to its reputation  coming out a little dry hunk of meat rather than a succulent steak  Pass this one by  if youre looking for a comfortable  enjoyable stay in downtown Chicago  The Water Tower is dry 
yfyGOVX6kO5xUSmgVnrj We booked this hotel as a last minute vacation planned on doing a little shopping and nightlife downtown  We where woken up at 6 00 in the morning with our bathroom flooded  this water was brown and all the clothing and our belongings left in the bathroom were dirty and sopping wet  We where moved to another room  but it was smaller then the orginal room we had gotten and paid for  The next day the housekeeping service never even came to change our sheets  coffee or towels  which is just horrible service  The service along with the orginal room where perfect  but we do not plan on ever spending another weekend in that flooding hotel 
yuzyPqQxB3CpLG8ILHeU Fairmont Hotels are generally my preferred choice  but this was a true disappointment  Check in was quite slow and problematic glitches with their reservation system locally  Room was very small and oddly arranged  Felt quite cramped in room and was hard to work at very small desk  Hotel overall felt quite cold and isolating   lobby is not at all inviting  and it didnt feel terribly safe walking around outside  Gift shop was overpriced  even for a downtown hotel  Food was disappointing  Overall this seems greatly overpriced and does not meet usual standards of A Fairmont ive come to count on  Bill was completely messed up and required 3 separate calls after i left to straighten out 
z47ILdDfuUiGbTlq8SFT The Hyatt Regency Chicago is one of the most beautiful hotels that I have ever stayed at  I stayed there for 3 days and two nights  My room had an amazing view and was clean and furnished beautifully  The staff was very kind and very helpful  The concierge staff was kind and helped me to find enjoyable things to do in Chicago  Overall  A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city 
zANlAIwui9ko1liFYmnX I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago while in town for business  and enjoyed my stay very much  I stayed in a room with a king bed  which was very comfortable  The room had all the things I needed for my stay  which was nice  The only thing is I think there was a party on my floor  but they quieted down quickly enough  My room even had an internet connection  I also had dinner one night at the China Grill  and it was an amazing meal  Overall  I had a great stay  and will return next time I am in Chicago 
zOa4juOxWTHWNgOOOe6u October 3rd  2007 My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel toward the end of September 2007  The hotel is VERY modern  The room was immaculate  but the furiture looked as though it came from IKEA  It was chipped in many places  The light switches were difficult to find  and the HVAC made noise  However  the bed was wonderful  The bathroom was large and well maintained  Housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted  The restaurant was small  You can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called Tempo  If you want a truly great breakfast try The Peninsula Hotel  However  after dining there you might not want to return to The Sofitel  Prior to checking in we had paid for everything in full  When we checked in  we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals  Upon returning home  we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the Sofitel had an authorization placed on it  This reduced the line of credit  and it took several days to be removed from the card  Great location  Reasonable value  If you have a Privilege Card they allow you to check out at 4pm as opposed to 12 in the afternoon 
zWV71X14ikF0ZbhcJjDC I recently stayed in the Talbott Hotel in Chicago with my family of three  I absolutely loved it and will definitely return  The customer service of the staff at the front desk was fantastic  They were very helpful in helping us decide on what activities to do and what restaurants to visit during our stay  For the nights we didnt want to go out  we had room service  The food from the Hotel restaurant was so delicious and the service was very quick  I also loved their commitment to the environment  It is clear to me why they have won so many awards  Thank you Talbott for a wonderful stay 
znXSc7eBGDLdR0OrjXDw My wife and I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and  after our experience there  we will not be returning  With a hotel that markets itself as luxury  we were expecting to get a big bang for our buck  We were disappointed  to say the least  First of all  we stayed in the King Deluxe room and it was uncomfortably small  The space was used poorly   my wife and I could not walk around the bed at the same time because there was so little space  The decor seemed rather dated and not of the best quality  Although they said our room woudl be ready at 3  we had to wait almost an hour past that for our room to be ready  Although the staff did offer a complimentary drink as an apology  they didnt seem terribly upset or apologetic about the inconvenience this caused  The noise at night from the city is horrible   even with the radio on in our room we could hear traffic and pedestrians on the street well past midnight  The hotel would not move us to a different room  All in all  I felt that we paid 100 00 for a luxury hotel and got a 40 Motel 6  We will definitely not be back anytime soon 
zrk0KdqyxKPblq7gEA7d I stayed at the Swissotel for a business trip the first week of Aug 2007  I arrived late the first night and got shoved into a hospitality room the first night  However  this was more than made up when after a strong talk they assigned me a corner room on the 28th floor  EXCELLENT view of the city  river and Lake Michigan  In fact  I would say the corner room of the Swissotel has a better view than any other hotel in the vicinity  The room was huge  and everything was clean and the bathroom was nice  The hotel is very convieniently located to the Magnificient Mile and Millenium Park  Would very much recommend this hotel  and would suggest trying every method possible to get a corner room in a higher floor
